<h2 class="eee"><i>PREFACE</i></h2>
<p>If all the world loves a lover, as the old proverb says, then
this my book should win wide fame. For these Greek
Romances of the first to the fourth century of our era seem
still to be singing the immemorial refrain from the old
spring-time song of &ldquo;The Vigil of Venus&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Cras amet qui numquam amavit,</p>
<p class="t0">quique amavit cras amet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let those love now, who never lov&rsquo;d before;</p>
<p class="t0">Let those who always lov&rsquo;d, now love the more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At a time when fiction is the most popular form of literature,
these wonderful old Greek stories of love, adventure
and worship are half forgotten and rarely read except by
the scholar. Yet here, as in epic, lyric, elegy, drama, oratory
and history, the Greeks were pioneers. In the second
and third centuries they had created four different types
of romance (of love, of adventure, the pastoral, the satiric)
which were to have great influence on French, Italian and
English fiction. The student of comparative literature,
the student of the history of fiction cannot afford to neglect
these pioneer Greek novels.</p>
<p>Their appeal, however, should be just as great for the
general reader as for the scholar. For here are stories
that mirror the life of the Mediterranean world in the
Roman Empire with all its new excitements of travel, piracy,
kidnapping, the new feminism, the new religious
cults. And through all the different types of romance except
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
the satiric the Love-God holds supreme sway over the
hearts of men. So human, so vivacious are the love-stories
that I offer to my readers Longus&rsquo; assurance of profit in
his introduction to his Pastoral Romance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I drew up these four books, an oblation to Love and to Pan
and to the Nymphs, and a delightful possession even for all men.
For this will cure him that is sick, and rouse him that is in dumps;
one that has loved, it will remember of it; one that has not, it
will instruct. For there was never any yet that wholly could
escape love, and never shall there be any, never so long as beauty
shall be, never so long as eyes can see. But help me that God to
write the passions of others; and while I write, keep me in my
own right wits.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My hope in writing on the Greek Romances is that I
may lure readers back to them. My essays aim to be guideposts
pointing the way. I venture to suggest that along
with my book readers should peruse at least four novels of
different types for which good translations are available.
These are <i>Chariton&rsquo;s Chaereas and Callirhoe</i> by Warren
E. Blake (beautiful in English and format) and three volumes
of <i>The Loeb Classical Library</i>: <i>Daphnis and Chloe
by Longus</i>, Lucian&rsquo;s <i>True History</i> (in Lucian vol. I) and
the Latin novel which combines the different Greek types
into one great synthesis, Apuleius&rsquo; <i>Metamorphoses</i>. If I
can win new readers for these my favorites, my writing will
be as successful as it has been happy!</p>
<p>It is a pleasure once again to express grateful thanks to
publishers and authors who have allowed me to quote material.
I am indebted to the Harvard University Press for
its courtesy in allowing me to quote freely from volumes in
<i>The Loeb Classical Library</i>; to the Clarendon Press, Oxford
for the use of material from R. M. Rattenbury, &ldquo;Romance:
the Greek Novel,&rdquo; in <i>New Chapters in the History
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
of Greek Literature</i>, <i>Third Series</i>, from F. A. Todd, <i>Some
Ancient Novels</i>, from J. S. Phillimore, &ldquo;Greek Romances&rdquo;
in <i>English Literature and the Classics</i>, and from <i>The
Works of Lucian of Samosata</i> translated by H. W. Fowler
and F. G. Fowler; to Longmans, Green and Co., for the
use of a quotation from F. G. Allinson, <i>Lucian Satirist and
Artist</i>; to the University of Michigan Press for the use of
Warren E. Blake&rsquo;s translation of Chariton; to the Columbia
University Press for permission to quote from S. L.
Wolff&rsquo;s <i>The Greek Romances in Elizabethan Prose Fiction</i>;
and for generous permissions for quotations from
Professor M. Rostovtzeff and Professor B. E. Perry.</p>
<p>My writing has been greatly facilitated by the cooperation
of the staff of the Vassar Library, especially of Miss
Fanny Borden, Librarian, who has provided me with a
study in the Library, patiently borrowed many books from
other libraries for me and shown unfailing interest in my
work. A constant stimulus to my writing has been the appreciation
of my colleagues and students expressed in invitations
to read different chapters of this volume to the
Classical Journal Club and to the Classical Society. Finally
my profound gratitude is due to the donors of the
funds which made possible the publication of these Essays.</p>

<br /><i>THE GREEK ROMANCES AND THEIR RE-DATING</i></h2>
<p>The term &ldquo;Greek Romances&rdquo; is applied to long stories in
Greek prose, written from the end of the first to the beginning
of the fourth century before Christ and later imitated
by Byzantine writers. It was one of these last, Nicetas
Eugenianus, who prefixed to his own romance a prelude of

<p>The subjects listed in these lines are typical of nearly all
the novels. An author selected new names for his hero
and heroine and portrayed the same quest for love and adventure.
The young pair always marvellously handsome
fall desperately in love and plight their eternal fidelity in a
sacred oath. Soon they are separated by misadventure or
the cruel will of Fortune and suffer alone every misfortune
and temptation, but by superhuman effort and often
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
by the aid of the gods, they at last emerge triumphant and
chaste and fall in exultation into each other&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>It was just because of this similarity of pattern that it
became the fashion for critics to belittle these melodramas,
to emphasize their similarities, and to disregard their
individual characteristics and enthralling style. Erwin
Rohde&rsquo;s great critical study, <i>Der griechische Roman</i>, was
perhaps the first to treat them with the serious consideration
which they deserve. Now Rohde&rsquo;s theories have to
be in large part rejected because of new discoveries in
papyri which have necessitated the re-dating of the extant
novels and adding to their study fragments of novels hitherto
unknown which help establish new types and give
a basis for a new critique.</p>
<p>My own discussion is to be concerned with the novels
themselves, their individual characteristics, their literary
qualities, viewed on the basis of their new dating. For
this reason I shall spend little time on the famous theories
of the origins of the Greek Romances and on their precursors.
For my purpose of intensive, literary study it is
enough to present these in outline.</p>
<p>In regard to the origins of the Greek Romances, two
special theories must be mentioned since they have had
more vogue than any others. These are the theories of
Erwin Rohde and of Bruno Lavagnini. Erwin Rohde in
<i>Der griechische Roman</i>, which first appeared in 1876, recognized
two essential elements in the Greek Romances:
stories of love and stories of travel. He studied the precursors
of these two types. He finally affirmed that the
synthesis of the two, the romance, is a direct product of
the rhetorical schools of the Second Sophistry which flourished
in Greece during the Empire. Rohde based his
work on the extant romances and the summaries of Photius
(Patriarch of Constantinople, 858-886) and believing that
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
none of this material antedated the second century of our
era, he constructed his theory that &ldquo;Greek romance was a
product of the <i>Zweite Sophistik</i>, and had no direct connection
either with the short story as represented by the
Milesian Tales or with any Greek or Alexandrian literary
form.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> W. Schmid in the third edition of Rohde (1914)
summarized in an Appendix the new discoveries and theories
after Rohde&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>I omit a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the work of Huet,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> Dunlop,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> Chassang<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
and of Chauvin,<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> all significant in their times, to
present a theory which is now more striking. In 1921
Bruno Lavagnini in a learned monograph, <i>Le Origini del
Romanzo Greco</i>, traced the development of the Greek
romance from local legends of Magna Graecia, Greece
proper, the Greek Islands and Asia Minor. He found
support for his theory in the titles of many of them:</p>
<table class="center">

</table>
<p>a Philippus of Amphipolis, which Suidas mentioned. In
his study he took into account the novelle or short stories
which Rohde believed had no influence on the novel, and studied the
<span title="Mil&ecirc;siaka" class="g">&Mu;&iota;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&#8049;</span>,
the short <i>Love Romances</i> of Parthenius,
the fragment of the <i>Aitia</i> of Callimachus, <i>Acontius
and Cydippe</i>. He showed that Rohde had entirely neglected
the important influence of the novella in the Greek
romance and had been mistaken in his insistence on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
fundamentally different character of the two. Rohde
claimed that the novella was realistic, the romance idealistic
and hence declared that any derivation of the romance
from the novella was impossible. Lavagnini recognized
other influences in the development of the romance, especially
those of satire and of the new comedy, but he maintained
that an essential feature was the historical. He admitted
that in the use of his local legends the events are
projected into an ideal and remote past.</p>
<p>The tendency in the new criticism of the Greek Romances,
notably in the work of Aristide Calderini,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> is not
to seek for any one main source for their &ldquo;origins,&rdquo; but
rather to consider all possible precursors in the field of
fiction who directly or indirectly influenced them. Their
name is legion and they appear in the fields of both poetry
and prose. For from the earliest times of Greek literature
the art of narration was in use. Epics presented narratives
of war in the Iliad, of adventure in the Odyssey, of
love in Apollonius Rhodius. Drama produced narrative
speeches particularly in tragedy in the role of the
messenger. Elegiac poetry developed subjective-erotic
stories, based on myths, or history, or real life, and written
in lyric mood in narratives or letters. Idyls finally portrayed
against a pastoral setting the outdoor loves of shepherds.</p>
<p>In prose, there are full-grown novelettes combining
love and adventure embedded in the Greek historians:
Herodotus&rsquo; story of Candaules&rsquo; wife,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> the story of Rhampsinitus&rsquo;
treasure,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> the story of the love of Xerxes,<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> the
story of Abradatas of Susa and Panthea in Xenophon&rsquo;s
<i>Education of Cyrus</i> which Whibley calls &ldquo;the first love-story
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
in European prose.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> Short stories or novelle in
prose are known from the accounts of the Milesian Tales
and from Parthenius&rsquo; miniature <i>Love Romances</i>. The
<span title="Mil&ecirc;siaka" class="g">&Mu;&iota;&lambda;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&#8049;</span> were written in the second century <span class="small">B.C.</span>, by Aristides
of Miletus and a collection of them was translated
into Latin by Cornelius Sisenna who died 57 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Their
character was definite: they were erotic stories of a lascivious
type. Their philosophy of life was that all men&mdash;and
women&mdash;are sinners, and this belief was embodied
in episodes from every-day life. Their amorality was such
that the Parthian Surena was horrified when in the Parthian
War of 53 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, a copy of the Milesian Tales was
found in the pack of a Roman officer. Other short local
tales, for example those of Sybaris and of Ephesus, shared
these characteristics of realism, irony and disillusion.</p>
<p>Parthenius of Nicaea wrote a collection of short <i>Love
Romances</i> of a very different type. This Greek elegiac
poet of the Augustan Age wrote his <i>Love Romances</i> in
Greek prose as a storehouse for his friend, Cornelius Gallus,
to draw upon for material for epic or elegiac verse;
and for this reason he put them forth in the briefest and
simplest form possible. Most of them are unfamiliar
stories even when they are about well-known mythological
characters. In many the love tales are set against a background
of war. Short as they are, both their subject
matter and style are significant for the development of
Greek prose fiction.</p>
<p>Moreover, the work of the rhetorical schools must be
considered among the forerunners of the novel, both in
Greek and Latin. Although we know now that the Greek
Romances were being written before the time of the New
or Second Sophistry which Rohde postulated to be their
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
origin, still in the Greek Romances as well as in the <i>Satyricon</i>
and in Apuleius&rsquo; <i>Metamorphoses</i>, there are many illustrations
of the influence of the practice cases of the
rhetorical schools. A study of the <i>Controversiae</i> in Seneca
the Elder and in the pseudo-Quintilian, a study of <i>The
Lives of the Sophists</i> by Philostratus demonstrates that in
these school exercises where &ldquo;oratory became a theatrical
fiction&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> lay many first drafts of a new literary genre,
the romance.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
<p>It is a pity that Erwin Rohde could not have lived to
revise himself his great work on the Greek Romances in
the light of the new discoveries about them. No scholar
has yet arisen equipped with his tremendous erudition
and penetrating criticism to succeed him worthily. Perhaps
indeed the time has not yet come to write a new
critical history of the Greek romance, for at any time
added discoveries may demand still further revision of
dates and consideration of types. But at this stage it is
essential to review the new discoveries and to try to estimate
their significance. This outline is based on three
important summaries: the introduction by Aristide Calderini
to his translation of Chariton;<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> the &ldquo;Appendix on
the Greek Novel&rdquo; by Stephen Gaselee in the edition of
<i>Daphnis and Chloe</i> and Parthenius in <i>The Loeb Classical
Library</i>;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> and the chapter on &ldquo;Romance: the Greek
Novel&rdquo; by R. M. Rattenbury in <i>New Chapters in the History
of Greek Literature, Third Series</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Most spectacular and important of the new discoveries
was that of the fragments of the Ninus Romance, first
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
published in 1893. They were found on an Egyptian
papyrus, on the back of which are written some accounts
of <span class="small">A.D.</span> 101. The writing of the romance is so clear and
beautiful that it is dated by experts as belonging to the
first century <span class="small">B.C.</span> As Rattenbury says: &ldquo;The Ninus Romance
is therefore the only pre-Christian specimen of its
kind; it is indisputably two centuries earlier than the
earliest of the completely extant romances (Charito), and
probably as much earlier than any of the known fragments.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
The remains consist of two separate fragments
with parts of five columns on the first and of three on the
second. Gaselee writes of the content:<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> &ldquo;in the first
(A) the hero, Ninus, and the heroine (unnamed), deeply
in love with one another, approach each the other&rsquo;s mother
and set forth their love, asking for a speedy marriage; in
the second (B) the young couple seem to be together at
the beginning, but almost immediately Ninus is found
leading an army of his Assyrians, with Greek and Carian
allies, against the Armenian enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fragment A is short enough so that we can read Gaselee&rsquo;s
translation of it:<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ninus and the maiden were both equally anxious for an immediate
marriage. Neither of them dared to approach their own
mothers&mdash;Thambe and Derceia, two sisters, the former Ninus&rsquo;
mother, the latter the mother of the girl&mdash;but preferred each to
address themselves to the mother of the other: for each felt more
confidence towards their aunts than towards their own parents.
So Ninus spoke to Derceia: &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with my oath
kept true do I come into thy sight and to the embrace of my most
sweet cousin. This let the gods know first of all&mdash;yes, they do
know it, and I will prove it to you now as I speak. I have travelled
over so many lands and been lord over so many nations, both
those subdued by my own spear and those who, as the result of my
father&rsquo;s might, serve and worship me, that I might have tasted of
every enjoyment to satiety&mdash;and, had I done so, perhaps my passion
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
for my cousin would have been less violent: but now that I
have come back uncorrupted I am worsted by the god of love and
by my age; I am, as thou knowest, in my seventeenth year, and already
a year ago have I been accounted as having come to man&rsquo;s
estate. Up to now I have been nought but a boy, a child: and if
I had had no experience of the power of Aphrodite, I should have
been happy in my firm strength. But now that I have been taken
prisoner&mdash;thy daughter&rsquo;s prisoner, in no shameful wise, but
agreeably to the desires both of thee and her, how long must I bear
refusal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That men of this age of mine are ripe for marriage, is clear
enough: how many have kept themselves unspotted until their
fifteenth year? But I am injured by a law, not a written law, but
one sanctified by foolish custom, that among our people virgins
generally marry at fifteen years. Yet what sane man could deny
that nature is the best law for unions such as this? Why, women
of fourteen years can conceive, and some, I vow, even bear children
at that age. Then is not thy daughter to be wed? &lsquo;Let us
wait for two years,&rsquo; you will say: let us be patient, mother, but
will Fate wait? I am a mortal man and betrothed to a mortal
maid: and I am subject not merely to the common fortunes of
all men&mdash;diseases, I mean, and that Fate which often carries off
those who stay quietly at home by their own fire-sides; but sea-voyages
are waiting for me, and wars after wars, and I am not the
one to shew any lack of daring and to employ cowardice to afford
me safety, but I am what you know I am, to avoid vulgar boasting.
Let the fact that I am a king, my strong desire, the unstable
and incalculable future that awaits me, let all these hasten our
union, let the fact that we are each of us only children be provided
for and anticipated, so that if Fate wills us anything amiss,
we may at least leave you some pledge of our affection. Perhaps
you will call me shameless for speaking to you of this: but I
should indeed have been shameless if I had privily approached
the maiden, trying to snatch a secret enjoyment, and satisfying our
common passion by the intermediaries of night or wine, or servants,
or tutors: but there is nothing shameful in me speaking to
thee, a mother, about thy daughter&rsquo;s marriage that has been so long
the object of thy vows, and asking for what thou hast promised, and
beseeching that the prayers both of our house and of the whole
kingdom may not lack fulfilment beyond the present time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So did he speak to the willing Derceia, and easily compelled her
to come to terms on the matter: and when she had for a while
dissembled, she promised to act as his advocate. Meanwhile although
the maiden&rsquo;s passion was equally great, yet her speech with
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Thambe was not equally ready and free; she had ever lived within
the women&rsquo;s apartments, and could not so well speak for herself in a
fair shew of words: she asked for an audience&mdash;wept, and desired
to speak, but ceased as soon as she had begun. As soon as she had
shewn that she was desirous of pleading, she would open her lips
and look up as if about to speak, but could finally utter nothing:
she heaved with broken sobs, her cheeks reddened in shame at what
she must say, and then as she tried to improvise a beginning, grew
pale again: and her fear was something between alarm and desire
and shame as she shrank from the avowal; and then, as her affections
got the mastery of her and her purpose failed, she kept swaying
with inward disturbance between her varying emotions. But
Thambe wiped away her tears with her hands and bade her boldly
speak out whatever she wished to say. But when she could not
succeed, and the maiden was still held back by her sorrow, &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
cried Thambe, &ldquo;I like better than any words thou couldst utter.
Blame not my son at all: he has made no over-bold advance, and
he has not come back from his successes and his victories like a
warrior with any mad and insolent intention against thee: I trust
that thou hast not seen any such intention in his eyes. Is the law
about the time of marriage too tardy for such a happy pair? Truly
my son is in all haste to wed: nor needest thou weep for this that
any will try to force thee at all&rdquo;: and at the same time with a smile
she embraced and kissed her. Yet not even then could the maiden
venture to speak, so great was her fear (<i>or</i>, her joy), but she rested
her beating heart against the other&rsquo;s bosom, and kissing her more
closely still seemed almost ready to speak freely of her desires
through her former tears and her present joy. The two sisters
therefore met together, and Derceia spoke first. &ldquo;As to the actual
(marriage?),&rdquo; said she....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fragment B the seventeen-year-old warrior is found
marshalling his forces, &ldquo;seventy thousand chosen Assyrian
foot and thirty thousand horse, and a hundred and fifty
elephants,&rdquo; and at the end beginning the advance at the
head of his cavalry:</p>
<p>And stretching out his hands as if (offering sacrifice?),
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is the foundation and crisis of my
hopes: from this day I shall begin some greater career,
or I shall fall from the power I now possess.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>In this Ninus Romance as we have it, the name of the
heroine is not mentioned, but her mother&rsquo;s name is Derceia
and that is a close variant of Derceto, the name of the
divine mother of Semiramis in the usual legend. So although
the type is different from that of the queen of
Babylon, the character is probably hers. It seems evident
that this early novelist was, then, building his romance
around historical characters. Rattenbury points this out
and also shows conclusively that the characteristics of all
the other romances are indisputably present in this early
fragmentary story:<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The impetuous but honest Ninus reappears clearly enough in
the Theagenes of Heliodorus, and the lovesick maiden of unassailable
virtue and almost intolerable modesty might be the heroine of
any Greek romance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ninus pledges his faith as later heroes take an oath.
He like them is the toy of Eros or Aphrodite. In the
extant romances,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The characters, the treatment, and even the plots are almost
stereotyped; and yet one difference is observable&mdash;a tendency to
abandon an ostensibly historical background in favour of a purely
fictitious setting. The relative dates of the authors are by no
means certain, but the fortunate discovery of papyrus fragments
of Charito and Achilles Tatius supports the view, probable on
other grounds, that Charito is to be considered the earliest, and
Achilles Tatius the latest. It is therefore of interest to notice
that Charito, though his hero and heroine are creatures of his
imagination, introduces some historical characters and some historical
events; his main story is fictitious, but he seems to have
been at pains to lend it a historical flavour. Heliodorus, somewhat
later, presents a picture of a fairly definite historical period,
but no more; his characters are all fictitious and there is no historical
authority for the sequence of events which he describes.
Achilles Tatius degrades romance from the realm of princes to the
level of the bourgeoisie. His story is frankly fictitious, and he
evidently had no feeling that romance should be related to history.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Rattenbury goes on to illustrate his theory of the change
from the semi-historical to the purely fictitious romance
by a study of the Alexander Romance and the new fragments
of other stories. The pseudo-Callisthenes Alexander
Romance in the oldest version extant is dated about
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 300. But papyrus fragments indicate that a large
part of the material in it goes back to a time shortly after
Alexander&rsquo;s death. From the evidence of our late pseudo-Callisthenes
version which probably followed tradition it
would seem that history was treated as fiction and little
attention paid to the love-story of Roxane which could
have furnished such a lively erotic interest. New fragments
of other romances show other great rulers used as
heroes.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> One is the Egyptian prince, Sesonchosis, called
by the Greeks Sesostris. Mythological characters too become
protagonists in romances: Achilles and Polyxena;
the Egyptian Tefnut, daughter of Phre, the sun-god, who
took her adventures in the shape of a cat wandering in the
desert of Ethiopia. Other fragments run true to the general
type of the Greek Romances in manifesting now this,
now that characteristic.</p>
<p>The sum total of all the fragments discovered up to date
gives convincing evidence of two important facts: first,
the extant Greek Romances are only a small part of the
output of this genre; second, the dating of all the fragments
places them between the end of the first and the
beginning of the fourth century of our era. The Ninus
Romance is the earliest fragment, Chariton&rsquo;s the earliest
complete romance, that of Achilles Tatius the latest. On
this framework a chronological list of the extant novels
arranged on the basis of proved data and the probabilities
of internal evidence and comparisons, shapes like this:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>It is to be observed that from internal evidence Xenophon
of Ephesus probably came before Heliodorus. Longus
is <i>sui generis</i>, and so stands apart from the typical
genre of the novels; in fact is a unique specimen of another
type, the pastoral romance.</p>
<p>The new discoveries from the papyri with the consequent
re-dating of all known material has given a strong
impetus to new study of Greek Romances; new editions
of text with translation are being brought out by English,
French, Italian and American scholars.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> The introductions
to some of these editions, especially those of Calderini
and Dalmeyda, are the first distinguished literary work in
the field since Rohde with the exception of Samuel Lee
Wolff&rsquo;s monograph on <i>The Greek Romances in Elizabethan
Prose Fiction</i>, New York, 1912.</p>
<p>The time has now come for a literary study in English
which will make available foreign criticism and present
perhaps some new ideas. I plan to discuss in successive

<br /><i>CHARITON&rsquo;S</i> CHAEREAS AND CALLIRHOE</h2>
<p>There are two reasons for beginning a perusal of the Greek
Romances with Chariton&rsquo;s <i>Chaereas and Callirhoe</i>. It
is &ldquo;the earliest Greek romance of which the text has been
completely preserved.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;a lively tale of adventure
in which a nobly born heroine is kidnapped across the
sea from Syracuse to Asia Minor, where her beauty causes
many complications and she is finally rescued by her dashing
lover.&rdquo; I quote from Warren E. Blake whose publication
of the Greek text and a literary translation of it are
a monument to American scholarship.</p>
<p>The date of the manuscript of this novel has been proved
to be not later than the middle of the second century <span class="small">A.D.</span>,
by the recent discoveries of papyrus fragments of it.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> Warren
Blake comments on the significance of these discoveries:<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In view of the complete absence in ancient literature of any
certain allusion to Chariton, he was long supposed to be the latest
of the authors of Greek romance, and was dated, purely by conjecture,
about 500 <span class="small">A.D.</span> But by a turn of fortune as truly remarkable
as any attributed by Chariton himself to that fickle goddess,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
three scraps of his book have been turned up in Egypt during the
last forty years. One of these scraps was found in company with
some business documents which date from about the end of the
second century of our era. Inasmuch as the place of discovery was
a small country town to which new works of literature would not
likely penetrate immediately on publication, and since in any case
an expensive book is almost sure to be preserved longer than day-by-day
business papers, we seem quite justified in setting the date
of publication back some twenty-five or even fifty years. Thus
it is probable that this novel was written at least as early as the
middle of the second century, only about one hundred years later
than most of the books of the New Testament.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The identity of the author is made known by the first
sentence: &ldquo;I am Chariton of Aphrodisia, secretary to
the advocate Athenagoras.&rdquo; Aphrodisia was a town in
Caria in southern Asia Minor. Its locality helps little
in expanding the autobiography of the author out of this
one crisp sentence. But the romance itself reveals more
of his personality. His fondness for court-room scenes
and his elaborate descriptions of them are what we would
expect from a secretary to a
<span title="rh&ecirc;t&ocirc;r" class="g">&#8165;&#8053;&tau;&omega;&rho;</span>
or advocate. His learning
is evident from his many literary and mythological
references. And occasionally he steps out of the role of
the impersonal narrator into his own character and speaks
in the first person to his reader. We will come to feel
rather sure of his interests and tastes as we read his
<span title="pathos er&ocirc;tikon" class="g">&pi;&#8049;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#7952;&rho;&omega;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8057;&nu;</span>.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to outline the plot of the eight books
of this romance, it will be well to clarify the story by presenting
a list of the characters.</p>
<p>The chief characters are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Chaereas</i>, the handsome young Greek hero, son of Ariston of Syracuse</dt>
<dt><i>Callirhoe</i>, the beautiful young Greek heroine, daughter of Hermocrates, a famous general of Syracuse</dt>
<dt><i>Polycharmus</i>, a young Greek, the devoted friend of Chaereas</dt>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_16">16</dt>
<dt><i>Hermocrates</i>, the general of Syracuse</dt>
<dt><i>Theron</i>, a pirate</dt>
<dt><i>Dionysius</i>, the governor of Miletus</dt>
<dt><i>Mithridates</i>, satrap of Caria</dt>
<dt><i>Artaxerxes</i>, king of the Persians</dt>
<dt><i>Statira</i>, his wife, queen of the Persians</dt>
<dt><i>Pharnaces</i>, the governor of Lydia and Ionia</dt>
<dt><i>Rhodogyne</i>, the sister of Pharnaces, daughter of Zopyrus, wife of Megabyzus, a Persian beauty.</dt></dl>
<p>The minor characters of importance are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Leonas</i>, a slave-dealer of Miletus</dt>
<dt><i>Plangon</i>, a female slave of Dionysius</dt>
<dt><i>Phocas</i>, slave and overseer of Dionysius, husband of Plangon</dt>
<dt><i>Artaxates</i>, the eunuch of Artaxerxes</dt>
<dt><i>Hyginus</i>, a servant of Mithridates.</dt></dl>
<p>The list of characters reveals at once a connection of
Chariton&rsquo;s novel with the Ninus Romance because of the
use of historical characters. Hermocrates, the great general
of Syracuse who defeated the Athenians in the naval
battle, 414 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, is the father of the heroine and is referred
to repeatedly with the greatest pride. Artaxerxes, the
king of the Persians, appears in person in courts and in
wars. Historical events too are mentioned as if to give
a background of reality: the contests between the Syracusans
and the Athenians; the war between the Greeks and
the Persians; the rebellion of Egypt against Persia; the
merit of Cyrus the Great in organizing the army.</p>
<p>Against such a background of plausible reality, the plot
develops along three main lines of interest: love, adventure
and religion. The story begins with the introduction
of the radiant young hero and heroine of Syracuse
when they fall in love at first sight at a festival of Aphrodite.
Almost immediately they are married, but their
ecstatic happiness is short, for Callirhoe&rsquo;s many other suitors,
angry at her choice, plot revenge. They make her
husband jealous by false stories of a lover whom his bride
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
favors, and, by staging a surreptitious admission to his
house of a lover of Callirhoe&rsquo;s maid, convince Chaereas
that his wife is faithless. In passionate fury he dashes to
his wife&rsquo;s room and when Callirhoe overjoyed at his unexpected
return rushes to meet him, he kicks her with
such violence in the middle of her body that she falls
down, to all appearance dead. Chaereas is tried for murder
and pleads for his own condemnation, but is acquitted
against his will by the appeal of Hermocrates.</p>
<p>Callirhoe is now given a magnificent funeral and buried
with much treasure. The heroine, however, who had
only fainted, soon revives, but while she is bemoaning
her sad fate, a band of pirates, led by Theron, breaks open
the tomb, steals the treasure, kidnaps the girl, then sets
sail with all speed for the east. At Miletus, Theron sells
Callirhoe as a slave to Dionysius, a noble Ionian prince.
He soon falls in love with his slave, but learning her story
(except the fact that she was already married which Callirhoe
omits) respects her tragic position and woos her
with delicacy and consideration. Callirhoe, on finding
that she is two months with child, decides to accept the
advice of the maid Plangon and marry Dionysius to give
her baby a father. Plangon assures Callirhoe that the
child will be considered a premature seven months baby,
and she secures from Dionysius a promise to bring up as
his honored children any sons of the marriage. Book III
tells how Chaereas found the tomb empty; how Theron
was captured, forced to tell the truth by torture and crucified;
how Chaereas and his bosom friend Polycharmus
went on a warship to Miletus in search of Callirhoe but
were captured and sold as slaves to Mithridates, satrap
of Caria.</p>
<p>Now Mithridates too had fallen in love with Callirhoe
on seeing her at Miletus. On returning to Caria he discovers
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
the identity of his slave Chaereas just in time to
save him from crucifixion because of an uprising of his
fellow-slaves, and tells him that his wife is now married
to Dionysius. Chaereas writes a letter to Callirhoe full
of penitence and of love and Mithridates forwards it by
Hyginus, his faithful slave, adding another letter of his
own promising Chaereas and Callirhoe his aid. Unfortunately
these letters fall into the hands of Dionysius himself
and that noble prince, in his mad passion for his wife,
conceals from her the news that Chaereas is alive and makes
a plot for the protection of his own interests. He appeals
to Pharnaces, governor of Lydia and Ionia, who is also in
love with Callirhoe, to help a scheme he has made. Pharnaces
thus prompted writes a letter to Artaxerxes, King
of the Persians, accusing Mithridates of trying to corrupt
Dionysius&rsquo; wife. The great King then summons Mithridates
to a trial for plotting adultery and sends also for
Dionysius and Callirhoe.</p>
<p>The court scene is full of magnificence and surprises.
Mithridates has no fear because in answer to the denunciations
of Dionysius he is able to produce as a witness
Chaereas who swears to his innocence and friendship.
Mithridates is acquitted and departs. Then the King
dismisses the court for five days before adjudging whose
wife Callirhoe is to be since now she has two living husbands.
Meanwhile he intrusts the lady for safe keeping
to his wife, Statira. Dionysius is torn between the promptings
of passion and reason. Chaereas is in despair at the
possibility of losing Callirhoe again. And Artaxerxes,
the King, like all the other great gentlemen in the story,
falls madly in love with Callirhoe for her beauty.</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s passion makes him postpone the court trial
a month on the pretext of a dream which demanded sacrifice
to the gods. His eunuch tries to persuade the heroine
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
to do herself the honor of submitting to the King&rsquo;s embraces,
but only horrifies and offends her purity. Now
Fortune again takes a hand in separating once more Chaereas
and Callirhoe, for a revolt of the Egyptians is announced,
the King must be off to war, and as usual the
queen and her suite go with him. Callirhoe accompanies
the queen by royal orders.</p>
<p>Dionysius of course serves as one of the King&rsquo;s generals.
He has a crafty piece of news conveyed to Chaereas that
in reward for his faithful service the King had given him
Callirhoe. Chaereas, believing this false story, and no
longer caring to live, enlists with the faithful Polycharmus
in the Egyptian army to fight against his rival. He is
allowed to collect an army of three hundred Greeks in
memory of Thermopylae and with them captures Tyre.
News of this loss makes the Persian King so anxious that
he decides not to travel with all his retinue, but to leave
the women on the little island of Aradus. Chaereas who
is proving a valiant warrior soon takes the island and discovers
Callirhoe among his captives. Both faint on seeing
each other but since joy never kills, they soon recover
and reunited tell all and forgive all.</p>
<p>Word suddenly comes that the Persian King has defeated
the Egyptians and their King is dead. Chaereas
and his men decide to sail home to Syracuse, but first in
response to the plea of Callirhoe Chaereas sends his prisoner,
the queen Statira, back to the King because she
had befriended Callirhoe in her woes. Callirhoe without
the knowledge of Chaereas writes a beautiful and affectionate
letter of farewell to Dionysius, intrusting to him
the care of her son. (Dionysius still believes he is the
boy&rsquo;s father!) The ship of Chaereas is driven by fair
winds to Sicily where Hermocrates and the people of
Syracuse receive the hero and heroine in amazement and
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
joy. Chaereas tells the story of all their adventures and
Callirhoe ends the tale with a prayer to Aphrodite: &ldquo;I
beg thee, never again part me from Chaereas, but grant
us both a happy life, and death together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this simple outline of the plot before us let us
study the way in which the story is told. Notable first of
all are the shifting scenes, for the action moves rapidly
from Syracuse, to Miletus, to Caria, to Babylon, to the
sea, to Tyre, to the island of Aradus and then at last back
to Syracuse after the full circle of adventures. The contrast
between the free Greek city of Syracuse and the
oriental kingdoms is constantly emphasized, but it is the
love of adventure for adventure&rsquo;s sake that spices the narrative.
The settings include, besides picturesque descriptions
of localities, court-room scenes which are full of contrasts:
the murder-trial of Chaereas in Syracuse and the
trial of Theron also; the arraignment of Mithridates for
adultery before the Great King in Babylon. Pageantry
of weddings and of religious ceremonies also enrich the
plot.</p>
<p>The characters are painted in bold, rich colors. Hero
and heroine are so beautiful that they can be compared
only to great works of art: Chaereas resembles the pictures
and statues of Achilles, Nireus, Hippolytus, Alcibiades.
Callirhoe is now Aphrodite incarnate, now Artemis.
Love is enflamed by their great beauty and enters
through their eyes at their first sight of each other. Chaereas
is proud and arrogant because of his looks and so
passionate that he is unrestrained in his anger when he
believes Callirhoe false. The kick which he gave his
bride is a blot on his character which the reader finds
harder to condone than Callirhoe did. She declares that
cruel Fortune forced her husband to this act, for he never
before had struck even a slave. He is also so mercurial
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
that he repeatedly gives way to despair and is repeatedly
saved from committing suicide by his devoted friend and
companion, Polycharmus. He appears in more heroic
guise as a warrior when he joins the Egyptians against
Artaxerxes and Dionysius, resolved to die in battle, and
wins a great naval victory. He is generous in sending the
captive queen back to her lord. And he fulfills the ideals
of romantic chivalry by declaring to Callirhoe at the end
that she is the mistress of his soul.</p>
<p>Callirhoe like Helen had the gift of fatal beauty so that
all men who saw her fell in love with her and she incurred
for a time the jealousy of Aphrodite. But in spite of
every temptation her spirit remained virginal and she was
persuaded to marry Dionysius only to give a nominal father
to her unborn child. She meets misfortune with natural
tears, but with more fortitude than Chaereas shows. And
she rules her anger even when the eunuch of King Artaxerxes
makes insulting proposals to her by remembering
that she had been well brought up and as a Greek taught
self-control. She handles difficult situations with a woman&rsquo;s
intuitive tact as when she writes a consoling farewell
letter to Dionysius, without letting her husband have the
pain of knowing of it and its tenderness. By it she secures
Dionysius&rsquo; care for the son he still believes his own. She
wins from Chaereas with gentle tact a promise to send
back the captives Statira and the beautiful Rhodogyne to
the Persians. And in meek devotion at the end she essays
to win even the goddess Aphrodite to complete reconciliation.</p>
<p>Polycharmus is a type more than an individual, for he
is to Chaereas what Achates was to Aeneas, the faithful
friend who accompanies him through all adventures.
With boyish zeal, he hides from his parents in Syracuse
his plan to go with Chaereas on his search for Callirhoe,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
but he appears on the stern of the ship as it sails in time
to wave a farewell to his father and mother. His chief
function is to encourage Chaereas and prevent his suicide.
At the end on their return to Syracuse he is rewarded by
being given Chaereas&rsquo; sister for a bride and a part of the
spoils of war for a dowry.</p>
<p>Dionysius is a sympathetic and noble character; indeed
his sins are all for love. He is in deep mourning for his
dead wife when Callirhoe is purchased as a slave by his
manager. Although he believes that no person who is
not free-born can be truly beautiful, he is overwhelmed
with love at the first sight of Callirhoe. With tactful
sympathy he draws out her story and believes it. He
never forces his passion upon her, but woos her delicately
through his maid-servant, Plangon, and is overjoyed when
Callirhoe finally consents to legal marriage for the purpose
of raising a family. Even then in spite of his desire he
delays the marriage that he may do Callirhoe the honor of
a great wedding in the city. His happiness is complete
to his mind when after seven months a son is born. So
it is because of his sincere love that when he hears that a
Syracusan warship has arrived to demand Callirhoe back,
he commends his slave Phocas who out of loyalty to his
master had persuaded barbarians to destroy the ship and
its crew. Dionysius&rsquo; only anxiety is that since some of
the men escaped, Chaereas may still be alive. This last
fact he conceals from Callirhoe and to comfort her for
Chaereas&rsquo; supposed death persuades her to erect a cenotaph
to her first husband&rsquo;s memory. Later when he receives
the intercepted letter of Chaereas to Callirhoe, he faints
with grief and fear, but coming to he believes the letter
forged as part of a plot of Mithridates to win the favor of
his bride, so he accuses Mithridates to the Great King.
Summoned to Babylon to the trial he is in constant terror,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
for &ldquo;he looked on all men as his rivals&rdquo; knowing the devastating
effects of Callirhoe&rsquo;s beauty. When Chaereas is
produced alive in the trial, he argues valiantly for the retention
of his wife with some telling thrusts at Chaereas,
but finally when he has lost his love, he bears his grief
like a man, having remarkable self-control, treasuring Callirhoe&rsquo;s
affectionate letter as true solace, and devoting
himself to her son. Dionysius, as Callirhoe reminds him
once, is a Greek with a Greek education.</p>
<p>Among the orientals, resplendent princes appear often
only to be numbered among the disconsolate lovers of
Callirhoe and because of their passion to assist in furthering
the complications of the plot. Such are Mithridates
and Pharnaces. More individualized portraits are painted
of King Artaxerxes and Queen Statira. Oriental magnificence
is the aura of the Great King&rsquo;s personality whether
he appears presiding in the court-room, or hunting in
Tyrian purple with golden dagger and elegant bow and
arrow on his caparisoned horse, or riding to war with his
great army and his retinue: his queen, her attendants, his
eunuchs, all their gold and silver and fine raiment. Yet
through this rich setting appears a wise ruler who takes
counsel of his advisers in times of crises, listens judiciously
to evidence in the court-room, and in war follows the military
traditions of Cyrus the Great. But he has his human
side: is influenced by wine, loneliness and the dark, and
succumbs to Callirhoe&rsquo;s beauty though he is married to
a great and subtle queen. Hoping to win the object of
his passion he is not above machinations with his eunuch
who acts as his go-between and with optimistic hope of
success even has Callirhoe taken along with the queen
when he goes to war. Yet when Statira is restored to him
by Chaereas&rsquo; magnanimity, he welcomes her warmly although
her news that Callirhoe is with Chaereas is like
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
&ldquo;a fresh blow upon an old wound.&rdquo; He appears most
human after hearing Statira&rsquo;s story of all that happened,
for he is filled with varied emotions: wrath at the capture
of his dear ones, sorrow at the departure of Chaereas, and
final gratitude that Chaereas had ended the possibility of
his seeing Callirhoe. Out of his own conflict of emotions,
he breaks gently to Dionysius the news of his loss
of Callirhoe and calls him away from personal sorrow by
giving him higher responsibility in the realm. Artaxerxes
is really made to appear in the novel as the Great King.</p>
<p>Statira is no less the queen. She is delighted when her
husband suddenly intrusts Callirhoe to her care, regarding
his action as an honor and a sign of confidence. She
encourages Callirhoe with tactful sympathy and secures
needed rest for her, keeping away the curious ladies who
hurry to the palace to call. After a few days Statira can
not resist asking Callirhoe which husband she preferred,
but her curiosity is not rewarded for Callirhoe only weeps.
As time goes on Statira&rsquo;s jealousy is aroused because Callirhoe&rsquo;s
beauty outshines her own and because she is fully
aware of the significance of the King&rsquo;s more frequent visits
to the women&rsquo;s quarters. So when Artaxerxes is preparing
to start off for war, the queen does not ask what will
become of Callirhoe because she does not wish to have
to take her, but the King at the end demands her presence.
Apparently Statira never betrayed her jealousy to Callirhoe,
for after Chaereas took captive all the women in Aradus,
Callirhoe has only praise for her kindness to relate to
Chaereas and calls Statira her dearest friend. Her generous
happiness in being able to return Statira&rsquo;s courtesy by
sending her back to her husband wins from Statira a just
encomium: &ldquo;You have shown a noble nature, one that
is worthy of your beauty. It was a happy sponsorship indeed
which the King intrusted to me.&rdquo; Callirhoe on parting
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
commends her child to the queen&rsquo;s care and secretly
consigns to the queen her letter to Dionysius. Statira is
still a subtle enough woman to enjoy telling the King at
once on her return without her rival: &ldquo;You have me as
a gift from Callirhoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Set off against the Great King of the Persians is Hermocrates,
the general of Syracuse who defeated the Athenians.
His greatness as an admiral is matched by his
leadership as a citizen. At the trial of Chaereas for the
murder of Callirhoe it is Hermocrates whose generous
plea in his daughter&rsquo;s name secures from the people a
vote of acquittal. He listens to the wish of the people
assembled when they urge him to marry his daughter to
Chaereas. When Theron, the pirate, is captured and
the crowd at Syracuse is milling about him, Hermocrates
insists on a public trial for him in accordance with the
laws and after the evidence is presented it is by a vote of
the people that he is condemned. Then Hermocrates
asks the people to vote to send a ship in search of his kidnapped
daughter as a reward for his patriotic services.
Callirhoe&rsquo;s pride centers in her father no less than in her
Greek blood. Her reunion with her father at the end of
the romance is almost as moving as her restoral to Chaereas.
Hermocrates shines forth in untarnished glory as
a patriotic admiral, a leader of thought in a democratic
state, and a devoted father.</p>
<p>The minor parts are painted with less subtlety. Theron,
the villain of the story, is a black-hearted pirate
dominated only by gain and self-interest, ready to save
his life at the expense of his fellow-sailors. Slaves are
presented as vivaciously as they are in comedy. Plangon,
the maid of Dionysius, is a shrewd, cunning opportunist,
ready to serve her master&rsquo;s interests but not without kindness
to the distraught Callirhoe in her plight of pregnancy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Artaxates, the eunuch of Artaxerxes, is venal, wily, complaisant
and low-minded. As the confidant of Artaxerxes
he takes his cues from his master&rsquo;s words, and solicits his
favor by an attempt to seduce Callirhoe&rsquo;s heart for him.
As a eunuch, a slave and a barbarian (says Chariton) he
could not conceive that Callirhoe would not yield to the
wishes of the King. When he is unable to persuade her
by flattery, he threatens her with the King&rsquo;s vengeance.
And when her words betray her love for Chaereas, Artaxates
can call her only a poor, foolish girl for preferring
a slave to the Great King of the Persians.</p>
<p>The use of the crowd by Chariton is another link between
his romance and drama, for it often fulfills the function
assumed by the chorus in tragedy, that is, the part of
the spectator who comments on the action and interprets
it. It is the people of Syracuse in assembly that persuades
Hermocrates to wed his daughter to Chaereas. The
crowd votes the crucifixion of Theron and attends it.
At Miletus the crowd joins in Dionysius&rsquo; prayer to Aphrodite
to protect Callirhoe and her son. The crowd at
Babylon is struck dumb with amazement at the radiance
of Callirhoe. And when the Great King is to decide
whether Chaereas or Dionysius is to be her husband, all
Babylon becomes a court-room as the people discuss the
rival partners. At the end of the romance, all the harbor
of Syracuse is filled with men to watch the ship come in,
and when Chaereas and Callirhoe are revealed on it, the
crowd bursts into tears. All rush to the theater and demand
that there at once Chaereas tell them his adventures.
&ldquo;Tell us everything,&rdquo; they keep shouting. They groan
at his misfortunes. They offer prayers for the future of
his son. They shout assent to his proposal to make his
three hundred valiant Greek soldiers fellow-citizens of
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
Syracuse. Indeed the crowd is constantly the background
of the action of the romance.</p>
<p>Various mechanical devices used in the development of
the plot show Chariton&rsquo;s art of narration. Conversation
as any novel demands is constantly used. Soliloquies are
introduced frequently: at some emotional crisis, Chariton,
instead of describing the thoughts and feelings of his
characters, has them burst into speech to themselves. Callirhoe
on hearing of the supposed loss of Chaereas with
the warship laments his death and the destruction of her
father&rsquo;s gallant vessel. Later beside the Euphrates river
when she can no longer see &ldquo;the ocean which led back to
Syracuse,&rdquo; she upbraids cruel Fortune for driving her
farther and farther from home. Again, in horror at the
proposals of the eunuch, she laments all her misfortunes
and expresses her resolve to die as befits Hermocrates&rsquo;
daughter rather than become the mistress of the Great
King. So too Dionysius on the return of Chaereas, after
attempts at self-control, bursts forth with despair and
jealousy into a lament over the imminent loss of his
love. At the same time Chaereas, believing that Callirhoe
loves Dionysius and will never return to him from the
wealthy Ionian, utters a bitter lament before attempting
to hang himself.</p>
<p>Letters also are an important means of developing the
plot in the Greek Romances, especially in Chariton. He
uses seven letters.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> Chaereas&rsquo; first letter to Callirhoe is
an impassioned love-letter with an appeal for forgiveness
and for an assurance that she still loves him. This is a
crucial letter in the plot because it is sent by Bias of Priene
to Dionysius himself who conceals it from Callirhoe. Bias
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
sends a brief business letter with it. Pharnaces, governor
of Lydia, on the instigation of Dionysius writes a letter
to Artaxerxes accusing Mithridates of trying to seduce
Dionysius&rsquo; wife. This letter is important for the plot,
because it motivates the trial of Mithridates. The Great
King on receiving it dispatches two laconic business letters
to Pharnaces summoning Dionysius and to Mithridates
calling him to trial. The other two letters do not affect
the plot, but reveal the characters of the senders. These
are the letters in Book VIII of Chaereas to Artaxerxes and
of Callirhoe to Dionysius. Chaereas proudly sends back
Statira unharmed as the gift of Callirhoe to the Great King.
Callirhoe with a woman&rsquo;s intuition comforts Dionysius for
her loss by gratitude for his protection, by assuring him
that she is with him in spirit in the presence of her son
whom she intrusts to his care. She begs him not to marry
again, but to bring up the daughter of his first wife and
her own son, eventually marry them to each other and
send him to Syracuse to see his grandfather. She includes
a message to Plangon and ends with an appeal to good
Dionysius to remember his Callirhoe. It is hardly strange
that Callirhoe concealed this masterpiece of epistolography
from her jealous husband, Chaereas.</p>
<p>The taking of an oath is often an important feature
of Greek Romances. In Chariton, Dionysius swears solemnly
by the sea, by Aphrodite and by Eros that he will
marry Callirhoe according to the Greek laws &ldquo;for the begetting
of children&rdquo; and will bring up any child she bears.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
Dreams too play their part in the plot. In a dream Dionysius
sees an apparition of his dead wife as she looked
on her wedding-day. His slave Leonas interprets the
dream as prophetic of his coming happiness with the newly
purchased slave, Callirhoe.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> Callirhoe in her sleep sees
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
a phantom of Chaereas who says to her: &ldquo;My wife, I intrust
our son to you.&rdquo; This dream determines her to
bring up her baby and so to marry Dionysius.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> In Babylon
when she is dreading having to appear in court, she
has a dream of her happy wedding to Chaereas in Syracuse.
The maid Plangon interprets the dream as a good omen
for future happiness.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> King Artaxerxes had a dream of
gods demanding sacrifice so he proclaimed a festival of
thirty days throughout Asia. This delayed his decision
between Chaereas and Dionysius, hence was most important
for the plot because wars arose before the court
was held and in them Chaereas and Callirhoe came together.<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Apparent deaths are a common device of the Greek
novelists and Chariton&rsquo;s plot turns on two, the supposed
death of Callirhoe from Chaereas&rsquo; blow and her subsequent
burial; the reported death of Chaereas on his warship.
Concomitant with such deaths are the unexpected
reappearances which add the element of surprise, so essential
for the characters and the crowd.</p>
<p>Descriptive passages are few and brief in Chariton and
are often worked out in a suggestive simile rather than in
a conspicuous purple patch. Chaereas was as &ldquo;radiant
as a star. The flush of exercise bloomed on his glowing
face like gold on silver.&rdquo; Callirhoe, recognizing her lover,
became more stately and lovely than ever, as a flickering
lamp again flares up when oil is poured in.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> Public ceremonies
are described at more length: the funeral procession
of Callirhoe,<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> her wedding to Dionysius.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> Space
is given too to the description of Artaxerxes&rsquo; hunt, that
favorite ancient sport;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> to storm at sea;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> to war.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> But
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
all these descriptions are concise in their picturesqueness.</p>
<p>Finally clarity in the narrative is secured by repeated
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s of the story either by the characters or by the
author himself. Callirhoe tells her tragic tale to Dionysius
with such sincerity that he believes it and honors
her as a free-born woman.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> Polycharmus relates his adventures
with Chaereas to Mithridates and thereby saves
his friend and himself from crucifixion.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> Chaereas at the
end unfolds the whole Odyssey of his wanderings to the
populace in the theater of Syracuse.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> At the beginning
of Book V Chariton epitomizes all the preceding part of
the novel and at the beginning of Book VIII he recapitulates
the preceding book and reassures his audience about
the final book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, I think that this last book will be the most
pleasant of all to my readers, and in fact will serve as an antidote
to the tragic events of the former ones. No more piracy or slavery
or court trials or battles or suicide or war or capture here, but
true love and lawful marriage! And so I am going to tell you
how the goddess brought the truth to light and revealed the unsuspecting
lovers to each other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The happy ending which Chariton here forecasts is an
essential feature of a Greek romance. For in this type of
literature in which Chariton is a pioneer, virtue must
triumph. The ethics demands that the hero and heroine
must be noble in character as well as in station and that
therefore justice must be done to virtue. The hero we
have seen must possess personal courage and military
courage. He must be capable of emotional devotion,
first of all to his lady, then to his friend, and always to
his father. His faults are those of pride, arrogance and
passion and his moments of brutality are condoned by his
contemporaries on account of his passionate temperament.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
He can be generous to his foes. He can show pity to the
unfortunate. But his sympathies, even when the type is
embodied in as noble a character as Dionysius, are evoked
by the free-born in distress, rarely by slaves. The virtues
of the heroine are first of all chastity, then loyal devotion
to parents, husband and child, pride of family, generosity
of spirit and sympathy. She is capable of resolute decision
and heroic action if her chastity is menaced or her
dear ones are in danger. Standards different from our
own best ones appear in the general attitude towards slaves
as an inferior class and in the brutality manifested in the
hero&rsquo;s kick, in executions on the cross, in torture of witnesses.
Cleverness and deception are traits which are
prized more highly than we admit now. The noblest
sentiments expressed are in behalf of liberty and patriotism.</p>
<p>Religion plays so important a part in the romance that
it demands a full treatment. Chariton&rsquo;s novel is dominated
by two cults: the worship of the abstract goddess
Fortune, the worship of the goddess of love, Aphrodite.
At the end of Book I Callirhoe, just after she has been
sold as a slave, in a soliloquy, upbraids cruel Fortune for
all her troubles, for the goddess made her lover her murderer,
surrendered her to tomb-robbers and now has let
her be sold as a slave. Again Callirhoe, when she finds
that she is pregnant, reproaches Fortune for letting her
bear a child to be a slave. And on the banks of the Euphrates
in another soliloquy Callirhoe again charges Fortune
with all her miseries and blames her for taking &ldquo;delight
in persecuting one lone girl.&rdquo; Mithridates tells
Chaereas: &ldquo;The whims of Fortune have involved you in
this melancholy drama.&rdquo; Queen Statira, when captured,
exclaims that Fortune has preserved her to see this day
of slavery. And the author of the romance as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the characters repeatedly attributes to Fortune the strange
and sad misadventures of his hero and heroine. Callirhoe,
Chariton says, &ldquo;was overcome by the stratagems of Fortune,
against whom alone human reason has no power.
She is a divinity who loves opposition, and there is nothing
which may not be expected of her.&rdquo; Throughout the
romance Fortune seems to be conceived not as blind
chance, but as a baleful goddess, who takes delight in
cruelty and torture.</p>
<p>In conflict with her machinations is the power of the
goddess of love whom the young lovers worship. As
clearly as in a Greek tragedy Aphrodite&rsquo;s influence is
predominant throughout the romance. At the very beginning,
Chaereas and Callirhoe see each other for the
first time at a festival of the goddess and immediately fall
in love. The end of the romance is the prayer of thanks
which Callirhoe offers to Aphrodite in her temple at Syracuse.
Callirhoe is so beautiful that over and over she
seems Aphrodite incarnate, now to the slave-dealer, Leonas,
now to Dionysius, now to the crowd at the time of
her marriage to Dionysius, now in Babylon. Prayers for
aid are constantly offered to the goddess by Callirhoe, by
Chaereas, by Dionysius, by Artaxerxes, and these worshippers
offer their petitions in her temples in Syracuse, in
Miletus, in Babylon, in Aradus and in Cyprus. Her power
is acknowledged; her favor is asked. Chaereas discovers
Callirhoe is alive by seeing a golden statue of her which
Dionysius had dedicated in the temple of Aphrodite near
Miletus. Chariton himself in his r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the beginning
of Book VIII records the influence that Aphrodite had in
his story. When Fortune was maneuvering to have Chaereas
leave his wife behind at Aradus, all unaware of her
presence, &ldquo;this seemed outrageous to Aphrodite,&rdquo; says
Chariton, &ldquo;who, though she had previously been terribly
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
angered at Chaereas&rsquo; uncalled-for jealousy, whereby he
had insolently rejected her kindness after receiving from
her a gift more superlatively beautiful even than Paris&rsquo;
prize, was by now becoming reconciled with him. And
since Chaereas had now nobly redeemed himself in the
eyes of Love by his wanderings from west to east amid
countless sufferings, Aphrodite felt pity for him, and, as
she had in the beginning brought together this noble pair,
so now, having harried them long over land and sea, she
was willing once more to unite them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final consideration about Chariton must be the
style of his work. And first of all the inquiry rises to our
lips: how did the secretary of Athenagoras become so
distinguished in the art of narration? Homer, I am convinced,
is the master from whom, as Dante from Vergil, he
took his beautiful style. The romance is rich in literary
allusions, but beyond all others Homer is quoted repeatedly
(twenty-four times indeed) and with great effectiveness.
Sometimes a mere transitional phrase is adopted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;while the words were yet on his lips.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In descriptions the brevity and simplicity of Homer are
used with such nicety that the language often trails off
naturally into the very words of the epic. In the thirty
day festival at Babylon</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;the sweet savor arose to heaven eddying amid the smoke.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Men are pictured fighting and in their close array</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;buckler pressed on buckler, helm on helm, and man on man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
</div>
<p>And as the conflict joined and Chaereas rushed against
his enemies, he</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;smote them right and left and there rose a hideous moaning.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Artaxerxes in his court is compared to Zeus among the
assembled gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> A phantom of Chaereas appears to Callirhoe
resembling him</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;in stature, and fair eyes, and voice, and the raiment of his
body was the same.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Callirhoe came into the court-room in Babylon,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;she looked just as the divine poet says that Helen did, when she
appeared to &lsquo;them that were with Priam and Panth&ouml;os and Thymo&euml;tes
... being elders of the people.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> At the sight of her, admiring
silence fell, &lsquo;and each one uttered a prayer that he might be
her bedfellow.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides this use of Homeric phrases in descriptions,
quotations are frequently introduced in conversations as
if Chariton found only Homer&rsquo;s words expressive to convey
the thought of one character to another.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> But far
more important than such uses of Homeric phraseology
is the intensification of emotional coloring by a quotation
from Homer at a crisis of poignant feeling. When Callirhoe&rsquo;s
nurse calls her to get up for it is her wedding day,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;her knees and heart were unstrung,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because she did not know whom she was to marry.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> When
Chaereas is told that his wife is an adulteress,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;a black cloud of grief enwrapped him, and with both hands he
took dark dust and poured it over his head and defiled his comely
face.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Chaereas is determined to set sail in winter in search
of his kidnapped bride, his mother begged him to take
her with him and cried in Homer&rsquo;s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;My child, have regard unto this bosom and pity me if ever I gave
thee consolation of my breast.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Dionysius suddenly learned at a banquet that Chaereas
was alive from reading his letter to Callirhoe,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;his knees and his heart were unstrung.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
</div>
<p>When Artaxerxes was smitten with love for Callirhoe, he
lay awake all night,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;now lying on his side, now on his back, now on his face.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Chaereas and Callirhoe had their ecstatic reunion
on Aradus,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;when they had had their fill of tears and story-telling, embracing
each other,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;they came gladly to the rites of their bed, as of old.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough illustrations of Chariton&rsquo;s use of Homer have
been given to show the manner of it. Different explanations
of Chariton&rsquo;s constant use have been advanced.
Schmid thinks it is an indication of the influence of the
Menippean satire with its mingling of prose and verse.
Jacob believes it due to Chariton&rsquo;s desire to make his
style poetic. Calderini is more understanding. He thinks
that Chariton, thoroughly familiar with Homer, quoted
him to express worthily some noble thought and that he
saw the peculiar emphasis which a quotation from Homer
could give to the expression of a sudden, violent emotion.
He also uses episodes from Homer (the appeal of Hecuba
from the wall to Hector,<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> the apparition of Patroclus before
Achilles,<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> the Homeric
<span title="teichoskopia" class="g">&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&chi;&omicron;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&pi;&#8055;&alpha;</span>).<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> More than all,
his style is usually Homeric in its brevity and simplicity;
and in his use of quotations, of scenes and of style he is
the first example of those relations between epic and romance
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
which became so important in the mediaeval literature
of the west.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></p>
<p>Other literary influences are apparent. The Milesian
Tales may have suggested Miletus as the locality for the
love-story of Dionysius. The Ninus Romance is the precursor
of the historical element which paints a background
of realism through the use of historical characters, notably
Hermocrates and Artaxerxes, and through allusions to
actual wars. Drama contributed the language of the stage
to the description of the action. And at one crisis when
Chaereas, who is believed dead, is produced by Mithridates
in court, Chariton explains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could worthily tell of the appearance of the courtroom
then? What dramatist ever produced so incredible
a situation on the stage? Indeed, you might have thought
that you were in a theater, filled with a multitude of conflicting
passions.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> In another passage Mithridates says
Fortune has forced the lovers to enact a very sad tragedy.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a>
New comedy contributed types of characters (particularly
the slaves), spicy dialogue and at least two quotations.<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a>
The influence of history and especially of Herodotus is apparent
in the use of local history, in narratives of adventure,
in depiction of the adulation of the eastern sovereign,
in the reflection of the great struggle between the
west and the east. The influence of the rhetorical schools
is seen in the court scenes which in both their cases and
speeches are strangely like those of the <i>Controversiae</i> of
Seneca and the <i>Declamationes</i> of Quintilian.</p>
<p>All these different literary forces combined to produce
a style of narration in Chariton which is at the same time
simple and ingenuous, yet rhetorical. His startling baroque
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
effects are achieved by just this variation from simple
concise epic narrative with strong Homeric coloring, to
intense dramatic moments of high tragedy, to comic scenes
of slaves&rsquo; intrigues, to love passages which before had found
expression only in poetry. Probably Chariton learned
the effective use of parallelism, contrast and surprise from
the schools of rhetoric, but he wields all his various tools
with such success that he has carved out a new form of
literature in his prose romance.</p>

<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s famous CXVI sonnet is the lyric <i>credo</i>
of those who believe that love can triumph over adversity,
old age and even death itself. The lines just quoted are
the quintessence of lyric romance.</p>
<p>Suppose now that the romantic novel or the modern
cinema wishes to feature this same theme: &ldquo;True love
lasts.&rdquo; How would either one convey the idea? I am
going to show you by a concrete and melodramatic illustration.
Here is a script for it.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a></p>
<p>A young Greek who has been seeking over the world
his kidnapped bride has come to Sicily, his resources nearly
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
gone. An old fisherman Aegialeus gives him hospitality.
It is night. The young man and the old man tell each
other their sad love stories. The old man is now speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a wealthy young Spartan and loved a Spartan
girl, Thelxinoe. She returned my love and presently we
had, no one knowing it, our heart&rsquo;s desire. But my darling&rsquo;s
parents proposed to marry her to another Spartan.
So we fled secretly together and Sparta pronounced sentence
of death on us both. We managed to travel to
Sicily. Here we lived in dire poverty, but in our happiness
we forgot all else because we were together. Soon
my dear died, but her body was not buried. I have her
with me and I love her always and I am with her.&rdquo; After
these words he led Habrocomes into an inner room and
showed him the mummy that had been Thelxinoe. She
was old now, but she appeared beautiful to her husband.
&ldquo;To her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I always talk as if she were alive. I
sleep here with her; I eat near her. If I come back tired
from my fishing, the sight of her comforts me. For I do
not see her as you do, my son. I see her as she was in
Lacedemon, as she was when we fled. I see the night of
our first love. I see our flight together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Greek exclaims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O my own dearest love, shall I ever find you even dead? Here
to Aegialeus the body of Thelxinoe is the great comfort of his life.
Now I have learned that age sets no bounds to true love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story of the second or third century <span class="small">A.D.</span> might
seem too macabre to be possible if the <i>New York Times</i>
of Nov. 12, 1940 had not recorded such a case at Key West,
Florida. Karl Tanzler van Cosel, aged X-ray technician,
had removed the body of Elena Hoyas Mesa from its crypt
and had kept it in his bed-room for seven years. He said
he had hoped to restore it to life. Perhaps Xenophon of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Ephesus who wrote this story of Aegialeus and his mummy
had heard some such &ldquo;true story&rdquo; which he embodied in
his novel. In any case, he has given us here an illustration
of how the theme &ldquo;true love is eternal&rdquo; may be pictured
in a realistic romance. Think how dramatic this
scene would be in a movie: the small inner bed-room of
the fisherman&rsquo;s hut suddenly lighted; the old man getting
his young friend to help him remove the front of the coffin,
then looking rapturously at the mummy inside and reaffirming
before it his life-long love. That is my illustration
of the heart of a realistic Greek romance.</p>
<p>Almost nothing is known about Xenophon of Ephesus
who wrote it. Suidas mentions his romance the <i>Ephesiaca</i>
in ten books (instead of the present eight) and speaks also
of a work he wrote on the city of Ephesus. Xenophon
probably was a native of Ephesus, for he shows intimate
acquaintance with many details of the cult of Artemis
there. His date can be given only approximately, but
considerable internal evidence helps us to place him. He
imitates certain passages in Chariton, so he must be later
than the second century <span class="small">A.D.</span> Certain references are very
important. He is later than Augustus, for he refers to
the prefect of Egypt and of course there was none until
after 30 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> He mentions the Irenarch of Cilicia, and
this official was not known before Hadrian.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> He refers
to the Artemision of Ephesus as if it were at the height of
its glory and contemporary.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> It was pillaged and burned
by the Gauls in 263 and only in part rebuilt. But, as
Dalmeyda points out,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> these details give us only vague
indications of the date. Until some fragment of papyrus
which can be dated is discovered, we can place Xenophon
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
merely with some probability about the end of the second
century of our era.</p>
<p>The novel itself is simple in language and brief in scope,
but complicated in plot from many kaleidoscopic changes
of scenes. There are so many exits and reentries of the
characters that we lose track of them. The brevity of the
narrative, the laconic expressions of emotion in it have
made certain critics maintain the theory that it is only
an epitome of a story, or a kind of scenario written as a
preliminary sketch of a longer work. It seems to me possibly
an intentionally short romance written briefly and
simply by an author whose taste was akin to that of Chariton
and who perhaps was intentionally showing a definite
reaction against the verbosity of other novelists.</p>
<p>Partly because of the brevity of the romance a synopsis
of the plot has to be long. So much is crowded into small
space, so many rapid transitions from scene to scene are
made, that a full sequential outline must be given before
we can study the significance and color of the romance.
Here then is the plot. The chief characters are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Habrocomes</i> of Ephesus, the handsome hero</dt>
<dt><i>Anthia</i> of Ephesus, the beautiful heroine</dt>
<dt><i>Apsyrtos</i>, a pirate chieftain</dt>
<dt><i>Manto</i>, the daughter of Apsyrtos</dt>
<dt><i>Moeris</i>, a Syrian, husband of Manto</dt>
<dt><i>Lampon</i>, a goatherd, slave of Manto</dt>
<dt><i>Hippothoos</i>, a brigand</dt>
<dt><i>Perilaos</i>, a high police official of Cilicia</dt>
<dt><i>Eudoxos</i>, a physician</dt>
<dt><i>Psammis</i>, a rajah of India</dt>
<dt><i>Araxos</i>, an old soldier in Egypt</dt>
<dt><i>Cyno</i>, his wicked wife</dt>
<dt><i>Aegialeus</i>, a Syracusan who kept a mummy</dt>
<dt><i>Polyidos</i>, a captain in Egypt</dt>
<dt><i>Rhenaea</i>, his jealous wife</dt>
<dt>A procurer of Taras</dt>
<dt><i>Leucon</i>, a male slave of Habrocomes and Anthia</dt>
<dt><i>Rhode</i>, a female slave, his wife</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>In Ephesus lived a lad named Habrocomes who was
sixteen years old. The beauty of his person was matched
by the nobility of his soul. He had one great fault, pride.
And he scorned Eros as less handsome than himself and
unable to control a man against his will. Eros enraged
armed himself against this arrogant boy. It was the time of
the festival of Artemis. At this festival it was the custom to
select fianc&eacute;s. There was a great procession of young
men and women. Anthia, daughter of Megamedes and
Evippe, led the girls, and she was garbed as Artemis. She
was so beautiful that the crowd forgot handsome Habrocomes
though a few exclaimed: &ldquo;What a couple Habrocomes
and Anthia would make!&rdquo; Here was Eros&rsquo; opportunity.
After the procession broke up and all were
attending the sacrifice in the temple, the two saw each
other and were vanquished.</p>
<p>Day by day, night by night love dominated them until
both were worn out by longing. Their parents not knowing
what this strange malady was sent embassies to the
oracle of Apollo at Claros. The god diagnosed their illnesses
as the same, needing the same cure; he foretold long
suffering for both, dangerous travel by sea, kidnapping,
imprisonment, death and burial, but he promised final
salvation through the goddess Isis and happy days.</p>
<p>The parents of Habrocomes and Anthia, puzzled and
grieved by the oracle, decided that at least they must use
the remedy suggested by the god. So Habrocomes and
Anthia were married, and they did not fear the future
because of their present joy. As time went on, however,
it seemed necessary to the happy pair and to their parents
that they should fulfill the oracle by going on a journey.
On the ensuing voyage both swore mighty oaths (Anthia
by Artemis) to be faithful to each other always. Next
they put in at Rhodes for rest. Habrocomes and Anthia
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
hand in hand visited all the city and dedicated golden
armor to the sun-god in his temple. Then they sailed to
Egypt, but the ship was becalmed and one night Habrocomes
had a frightful dream. A giantess clad in red appeared
to him who set fire to the ship, destroyed all the
sailors and saved only himself and Anthia. He awoke in
terror and terror became reality. Phoenician pirates arriving
in a great trireme boarded the ship and drove the
sailors into the sea where they drowned. Then they fired
the ship, but took captive Habrocomes and Anthia and bore
them off to the country near Tyre. Corymbos, one of the
pirates, became enamored of Habrocomes; his bosom companion
fell in love with Anthia, but before they could
accomplish their wicked designs on them, the chief of
the pirate band Apsyrtos arrived and appropriating the
handsome young pair as part of his booty took them to
Tyre.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of worse troubles, for while
Apsyrtos was away on business, his daughter Manto fell
in love with Habrocomes and made advances to him
through a slave and a letter. When he refused to satisfy
her desires, for vengeance she accused him to her father
of having tried to rape her. Apsyrtos had Habrocomes
flogged, tortured and cast into prison. Anthia contriving
a secret visit to her husband told him she had been
given as a slave to Manto and must accompany her to
Syria, where Manto&rsquo;s newly acquired husband Moeris
lived. The two slaves of Habrocomes and Anthia, Leucon
and Rhode, were sold into a distant land. Manto
to disgrace Anthia as much as possible married her to
one of her humblest slaves, Lampon, a goatherd. But
Lampon pitying Anthia on hearing from her own lips her
story respected her and never made her his actual wife.
In Tyre Apsyrtos happened to find the love-letter which
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
his daughter had written to Habrocomes. Learning from
it his unjust treatment of Habrocomes he released him
from prison, gave him his freedom, and made him steward
of his house.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Syria Anthia&rsquo;s fatal beauty had inflamed
Manto&rsquo;s husband Moeris with a mad passion for her. He
confided this to the goatherd Lampon begging for his aid.
Lampon to save Anthia went secretly and told Manto her
husband&rsquo;s designs. Manto in jealous fury ordered Lampon
to kill the woman. In sorrow he told Anthia all and
together they planned that instead of killing her he should
sell her as a slave in some remote district. He managed
to hide this transaction and saved her life by selling her to
some Cilician merchants. But their ship was wrecked in
a storm. A few (among them Anthia) came to land on a
raft and after wandering all night in the woods were captured
by the brigand Hippothoos.</p>
<p>Manto meanwhile wrote to her father a letter made up
of truth and lies, saying that the slave Anthia had been so
troublesome she had given the girl to a goatherd and afterwards
when Moeris became enamored of the woman, she
had sold both the goatherd and his wife in Syria. Habrocomes
at once started out in search for Anthia and finding
Lampon and learning the true story from him, he set forth
for Cilicia.</p>
<p>There, however, Anthia had been in great danger.
Hippothoos and his brigands were about to sacrifice her
to Ares, but she was rescued by a high police official of the
district, Perilaos, who captured all the brigands except
Hippothoos. He took her to Tarsus and of course soon
fell in love with her. He offered her honorable marriage,
wealth, children and she fearing his violent passion forced
herself to consent but asked for a month&rsquo;s delay.</p>
<p>Now Habrocomes riding through Cilicia on his quest
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
met by chance Hippothoos who begged to be allowed to
travel with him. They went into Cappadocia and there
dining together told each other their life histories, Hippothoos
his love of a beautiful lad and the loss of him,
Habrocomes his love for the beautiful Anthia and his loss
of her. The description of Anthia made Hippothoos relate
his capture of a fair maiden and her rescue. Habrocomes,
convinced that the girl was Anthia, persuaded Hippothoos
to join him in his search.</p>
<p>But the preparations for the wedding of Perilaos and
Anthia were going on apace, and it would have been consummated
had not Anthia found a friend in an Ephesian
physician Eudoxos to whom she confided her tragedy.
She begged him to give her poison so that she might die
faithful. She promised him silver so that he might return
to Ephesus. Eudoxos gave her not poison but a
sleeping potion, then hurriedly departed. The very night
of her wedding, in the nuptial chamber, Anthia took what
she believed poison. Perilaos coming to his bride found
a corpse. To do her all honor, the bereft bridegroom had
her placed in a magnificent tomb with splendid funeral
gifts.</p>
<p>Robbers broke in the tomb for the treasure just as
Anthia awoke. They carried her off with them to Alexandria.
No one else knew she was alive. Habrocomes
heard from an old woman the story of Anthia&rsquo;s death, of
the pillaging of her tomb and the carrying off of her body.
So leaving Hippothoos he started off alone by ship for
Egypt hoping to find the brigands who had committed
such sacrilege. The bandits had already sold Anthia to
a rajah named Psammis, but Anthia saved herself from his
amorousness by telling him that she was a consecrated
priestess of Isis so he respected her.</p>
<p>Habrocomes&rsquo; ship missed its course to Alexandria and
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
landed in Phoenicia. There the inhabitants set upon the
strangers and capturing them sold them as slaves at Pelusium,
Habrocomes to an old soldier, Araxos. This soldier
had a hideous and wicked wife Cyno who, falling in
love with Habrocomes, offered to kill her husband and
marry him. When he refused, she herself killed her husband
and accused Habrocomes of the murder. He was
sent to Alexandria to be tried. Hippothoos meanwhile
had gathered a new band and in his travels had come to
Egypt and made the mountains near the frontiers of Ethiopia
his center for expeditions. Habrocomes was condemned
to death by the Prefect of Egypt, but his execution
was twice frustrated by miracles caused by the Nile river
when he appealed to the sun-god Helios for aid against
injustice. So he was cast into prison.</p>
<p>At this time Psammis started home to India with a great
camel train taking Anthia with him. At Memphis Anthia
offered prayers to Isis begging her aid. As they neared the
borders of Ethiopia, Hippothoos with his band fell upon
their caravan and, slaying Psammis and many men, seized
his treasure and took captive Anthia. Hippothoos and
Anthia did not recognize each other.</p>
<p>The Prefect of Egypt, on giving Habrocomes a new hearing,
was convinced of his innocence, freed him and gave
him money. So Habrocomes took ship again and went
to Italy to make inquiries there about Anthia. Cyno was
executed.</p>
<p>Anthia was again in danger because of the lust of one of
the bandits, Anchialos. He, while Hippothoos was away,
tried to do violence to her, but she stabbed him fatally
with a sword which she had found. Hippothoos on his
return decided, in vengeance for the death of his companion,
to kill her in a horrible way: to put her in a deep
trench with two fierce dogs. But the bandit set to guard
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the trench from pity secretly conveyed food to her so that
she fed and tamed the beasts.</p>
<p>Habrocomes on arriving at Syracuse in Sicily lived with
a poor old fisherman named Aegialeus who treated him
like a son and told him his own sad love-story. This is the
story of the Mummy in the House. Hippothoos left Ethiopia
to go to Alexandria and believing Anthia dead made
no inquiries about her. The bandit left to guard her,
now in love with her, hid in a cave with a good store of
provisions until the caravan had gone, then released Anthia
and the devoted dogs. He swore by the Sun and the
gods of Egypt to respect her until she voluntarily came to
his arms, so dogs and all they started on their travels.</p>
<p>The Prefect of Egypt had sent a company of soldiers
under Polyidos to disperse the bandits of whose marauding
he had heard. Hippothoos&rsquo; band was broken up; indeed
he alone escaped. He embarked on a ship for Sicily.
Polyidos next captured Anthia and her escort. Polyidos
although he had a wife in Alexandria at once fell in love
with Anthia and when they reached Memphis, tried to
rape her, but she fled to the temple of Isis as a suppliant.
Polyidos then swore that he would respect her if she would
return to him, saying that to see her and speak to her
would satisfy his love, so she went back to his care. On
their arrival at Alexandria, Rhenaea the wife of Polyidos
was nearly insane with jealousy of the girl her husband had
brought home. One day in her husband&rsquo;s absence she
beat and reviled poor Anthia, then gave her to a faithful
slave with orders to take her to Italy and sell her there to
a procurer. This he did at Taras.</p>
<p>Hippothoos by this time had reached Sicily and was
staying at Tauromenium. Habrocomes at Syracuse in despair
planned to go to Italy and if he found no news of
Anthia there, to return to Ephesus. The parents of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
young pair in their anxiety over them had died. The
slaves Leucon and Rhode who had been sold in Lycia had,
on the death of their master, inherited his wealth. They
were on their way back to Ephesus but were staying at
Rhodes.</p>
<p>The procurer now forced Anthia to stand in front of
his brothel, magnificently arrayed, to attract customers.
When many had gathered because of her beauty, Anthia
feigned a seizure and fell down in the sight of all in convulsions.
Later when she declared to the procurer that
she had had this malady since childhood, he treated her
kindly.</p>
<p>Hippothoos in Tauromenium had come into great need.
So when an elderly woman fell in love with him, constrained
by poverty, he married her. Very shortly she
died, leaving him all her possessions. So he set sail for
Italy always hoping to find his dear Habrocomes. Arriving
at Taras he saw Anthia in the slave market where the
procurer because of her illness was exhibiting her for sale.
Hippothoos, recognizing her, learned from her lips her
story, pitied her, bought her and offered her marriage.
Finally Anthia told him that she was the wife of Habrocomes
whom she had lost. Hippothoos on hearing this
revealed his devotion to Habrocomes and promised to
help her find her husband.</p>
<p>Habrocomes also had come to Italy, but in despair had
given up his quest and started back to Ephesus. Stopping
at Rhodes on his voyage he was discovered by Leucon and
Rhode, who now took care of him. Next Hippothoos
also arrived at Rhodes, for he was taking Anthia back to
Ephesus. It was the time of a great festival to Helios. At
the temple Anthia dedicated locks of her hair with an inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;In behalf of her husband Habrocomes Anthia dedicates her
locks to the god.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This inscription was seen by Leucon and Rhode and the
next day they found Anthia herself in the temple and told
her that Habrocomes was alive and near and faithful.
The good news spread through the city. A Rhodian carried
the word to Habrocomes and he came running like a
madman through the crowd, crying: &ldquo;Anthia!&rdquo; Near
the temple of Isis he found her, and they fell into each
other&rsquo;s arms. Then while the people cheered, they went
into the temple of Isis and offered thanks to the goddess
for their salvation. Then they went to the house of Leucon
and at a banquet that night told all their adventures.</p>
<p>When at last Habrocomes and Anthia were got to bed,
they assured each other that they had kept their oaths of
faithfulness. The next day all sailed to Ephesus. There
in the temple of Artemis Habrocomes and Anthia offered
prayers and sacrifices; also they put up an inscription telling
what they had suffered and achieved. They erected
magnificent sepulchres for their parents. And they passed
the rest of their lives together as though every day were a
festival. Leucon and Rhode shared all their happiness
and Hippothoos too established himself in Ephesus to be
near them.</p>
<p>From this summary of the plot, it is at once apparent
that the chief interests of the romance are love, adventure
and religion. The three are used by Xenophon with almost
equal distribution of interest and emphasis. Two divinely
beautiful young people (the lad only sixteen) fell in
love with each other at first sight at the festival of Artemis.
Habrocomes had been too proud of his appearance and
in his arrogance had scorned the beautiful god of Love as
his inferior. So Eros brought him low and made the pair
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
suffer many misfortunes through separation. However
they were married first and through all their troubles they
were true to their oaths of mutual faithfulness. Temptations
and adventures could not nullify their chastity, but
their victories were often superhuman and made possible
only by miracles and the aid of protecting gods. Anthia
after a dream of seeing Habrocomes drawn away from her
by another fair lady awoke to utter the belief that if he had
broken faith, he had been forced by necessity; and for
herself she would die before losing her virtue.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> At the
end, when Anthia had proudly recounted the lovers she
had escaped, Moeris, Perilaos, Psammis, Polyidos, Anchialos,
the ruler of Taras, Habrocomes was able to reply
that no other lady had ever seemed to him fair or desirable:
his Anthia found him as she had left him in the
prison at Tyre.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> So hero and heroine shine as types of
perfect virtue. The nobility of the romance, as Dalmeyda
points out, appears not only in the purity of Habrocomes
and Anthia, but in a restrained expression of the sentiments
and the acts of love.<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a></p>
<p>The course of this true love was proverbially unsmooth
and after the pair were separated, the plot seesaws between
the adventures of hero and heroine. These are varied, exciting
and often closely paralleled. Both were assailed by
amorous lovers, Anthia by at least nine, Habrocomes by
Corymbos, a pirate, by Manto, daughter of the chief of the
pirate band, and by Cyno, the lewd wife of an old soldier.
Both were shipwrecked, Anthia twice. Both nearly met
death: Anthia as a human sacrifice, by taking poison, by
being thrown in a trench with fierce dogs; Habrocomes
by crucifixion and pyre. Bandits and pirates captured
both. Both were nearly executed for murder, Anthia for
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
actually killing a bandit who attacked her, Habrocomes on
the false charge of Cyno. Both were sold into slavery, Habrocomes
once, Anthia over and over again. Strangely
enough among their adventures war played little part:
the only wars described are official expeditions against
bandits.</p>
<p>From most of these adventures the pair were saved by
their piety. Never did they lose an opportunity of offering
prayer, thanksgiving, vows and sacrifices to the gods.
The story begins with the festival of Artemis at Ephesus
at which Habrocomes and Anthia fell in love and ends
with their return to her temple to offer thanksgiving for a
happy ending out of all their misfortunes. At the festival
Anthia appeared as the priestess of Artemis and led a procession
of maidens in which she alone was garbed as Artemis.
This may be a symbol of her resolute chastity.
Many details of the worship of the goddess are given which
seem based on reality.<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> Artemis appears not as the Ephesian
goddess of fertility, but as the protectress of chastity
and in this function joins with Isis in safeguarding the
purity of the heroine.</p>
<p>Eros is the offended god who undoubtedly in vengeance
caused the violent love of Habrocomes, the separation and
the miseries of the unhappy pair. There are few references
to Aphrodite: to her son rather than to herself is
given the function of inspiring love. On the Babylonian
baldequin over the marriage bed of Habrocomes and
Anthia there had been woven a scene in which Aphrodite
appeared attended by little Loves and Ares unarmed was
coming towards her led by Eros bearing a lighted torch.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a>
Habrocomes at Cyprus offered prayers to Aphrodite.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a></p>
<p>The oracle of Apollo at Claros determined the plot by
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
ordering the marriage of Habrocomes and Anthia and
predicting their voyaging, their separation, their disasters,
their reunion. But its clauses are not sufficiently explained:
we are never told why the young bride and
groom and their parents feel they must start out on their
fateful journey. Some think the obscurity is due to
Xenophon&rsquo;s epitomizer. There are other possible explanations.
The action may be an abandoning of themselves
to the will of the gods; or a bold step towards their final
promised safety; or a flight from the city where they had
suffered so much. An oracle is the traditional prelude to
a voyage of adventure. Xenophon uses it, says Dalmeyda,
to pique curiosity, to render the misfortunes of the two
more dramatic by the prophecy of them and to reassure
his readers about a happy ending.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>In happiness or distress both the young lovers honored
the god of the place in which they found themselves. In
the first part of their journey together they offered sacrifice
to Hera in her sanctuary at Samos.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> At Rhodes, Habrocomes&rsquo;
prayer to Helios saved him from crucifixion and
burning through the miracles of the Nile.<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a> Perhaps
Helios was rewarding Habrocomes for the golden armor
which he and Anthia had jointly dedicated to him at
Rhodes in his temple.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> This votive had another certain
part in the plot because when Habrocomes returned there
alone to pray near his votive, Leucon and Rhode, who
had been reading the inscription set up near it by their
masters, recognized him and revealed themselves.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> At
Memphis Anthia appealing to the pity of the god Apis
received from his famous oracle a promise that she would
find Habrocomes.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a></p>
<p>Ares appears only in Xenophon. This is strange when
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
war plays such a part in the other romances. In the
<i>Ephesiaca</i>, Hippothoos and his bandits at the festival of
Ares had the custom of suspending the victim to be sacrificed,
human being or animal, from a tree and killing it by
hurling their javelins at it. They were preparing to sacrifice
Anthia in this way when she was rescued.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a></p>
<p>The other cult which is as important as that of Artemis
for the story is the cult of Isis. Anthia saved herself from
Psammis&rsquo; advances by declaring that she was a consecrated
priestess of Isis so the rajah respected her person.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> At
Memphis in her temple, Anthia appealed to Isis who had
preserved her chastity in the past to grant her salvation and
restore her to Habrocomes.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> To escape Polyidos&rsquo; lust,
Anthia took refuge at the sanctuary of Isis at Memphis and
again besought the goddess for aid. Polyidos in fear of
Isis and pity for Anthia promised to respect her.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> Finally
near that temple of Isis Habrocomes and Anthia found
each other and in the same temple they offered prayers of
thanksgiving.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> Isis thus in the <i>Ephesiaca</i> figures as the
protectress of chastity.</p>
<p>The worship of Isis had been carried to the coast of Asia
Minor by sailors and traders. In the empire both Artemis
and Isis had statues in the Artemesion of Ephesus.
The Egyptian cult, purified and penetrated with moral
ideas, seems to belong to the second century <span class="small">A.D.</span> From
its very nature, the goddess Isis becomes as natural a protector
of Anthia as is Artemis.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> This synthesis of the
two goddesses in one protectress of the heroine is a natural
process of the philosophical thought of the time. In a
modern novel or a cinema, better clarity would be attained
for our non-philosophical minds if one goddess, Isis, was
worshipped by Anthia and was the deity of her salvation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Apuleius achieved just this simplification in his novel by
making Isis the one and only savior of his hero Lucius.</p>
<p>To develop and sustain these three main interests of the
story, love, adventure and religion, the usual devices of a
plot are employed. The setting is cinematic in its many
changes: Ephesus, the ocean, Samos, Rhodes, Tyre, Syria,
Cilicia, Cappadocia, Egypt, Sicily, Italy, Rhodes again,
back to Ephesus, and thrown in with the setting are many
geographical details which are often wrong.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> The characters
are familiar types: the ravishingly beautiful hero
and heroine, their perturbed parents, high officials (Perilaos
and Psammis) who take the place of historical characters,
faithful slaves, a wily procurer, a doctor, pirates, bandits.</p>
<p>Dalmeyda has written a discriminating paragraph on
the morality of the characters.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> He says that of course all
the characters of the romance do not attain the perfection
of virtue of the two protagonists, but altogether the author
shows us a gallery of persons without wickedness who are
sympathetic and who have an air of honesty even in the
exercise of the worst occupations. Manto, who falsely
accuses Habrocomes of having wished to violate her and
who has him cruelly tortured, is motivated by an overwhelming
passion. Apsyrtos, her father, chief of the pirates,
shows himself just and generous to the hero when he
has discovered his daughter&rsquo;s calumny. The slaves are
devoted and faithful. Lampon to whom Manto gives
Anthia as his wife is a rustic full of civility and goodness.
The man who traffics in young girls to whom Anthia is
sold shows a noble sympathy when she pretends to be afflicted
with seizures. Hippothoos, a brigand chief, exercises
his trade ruthlessly putting villages to fire and sword;
he has a weakness too for handsome lads; but to Habrocomes
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
he is a faithful and devoted friend. He renounces
his passion for Anthia when he finds she is the wife of his
friend and aids her in every way in her search for Habrocomes.
It is this recognition of some good in every human
being that gives Xenophon his large humanity.</p>
<p>Oracles are given by Apollo at Claros and by Apis in
Memphis. Dreams and visions disturb both hero and
heroine. A letter (Manto&rsquo;s) is important for the plot.
Some conversation is used. A court-room scene is sketched
in, Habrocomes&rsquo; trial for murder before the prefect of
Egypt. Soliloquies are frequent since woeful lovers parted
must bewail their lot. Attempted suicides testify to their
despair.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> R&eacute;sum&eacute;s of adventures are helpfully presented
by important characters at different stages in the
narrative. And after a hundred hair-breadth escapes,
journeys end in lovers&rsquo; meetings as the oracle of Apollo
had reassuringly predicted at the beginning of the romance.</p>
<p>In spite of the use of these conventions, the story has a
lively and compelling interest. We are led to share the
admiration and marvel of the characters themselves. We
are moved by the pity which they often feel. Their piety
induces in us reverence. We agree with their preference
for Greeks rather than barbarians. And we admire the
romantic love which maintains faithfulness in the face of
death, or outlives death itself.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></p>
<p>The style of this gem of a novel is finely cut, clear and
beautiful in its pure Atticism. Dalmeyda, who follows
Rohde and B&uuml;rger in believing the present form of the
romance is due to an epitomizer, yet has to admit that all
the &ldquo;naked simplicity&rdquo; of the style is not due to the redactor.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a>
This characteristic is so distinctive of the author
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
that it seems to differentiate him from other writers of
romance by giving his story the air of a popular tale.
Sometimes, Dalmeyda continues, the expression is double,
as if in a sort of naive elegance. Words are repeated awkwardly.
Stereotyped formulae are used. The author
gives every person a name even if he appears only once.
Love is generally expressed in conventional terms, which
are however intended to suggest its violent or tragic character.
There is even a ready-made formula for ecstasy
(<span title="ouketi karter&ocirc;n" class="g">&omicron;&#8016;&kappa;&#8051;&tau;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&#8182;&nu;</span>
or <span title="ouketi pherein dynamenos" class="g">&omicron;&#8016;&kappa;&#8051;&tau;&iota; &phi;&#8051;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; &delta;&upsilon;&nu;&#8049;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>).
But the passion of
Habrocomes and Anthia is expressed differently. At their
final reunion Xenophon describes with force and delicacy
their joy which is both tender and passionate.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<p>Whether &ldquo;the naked simplicity&rdquo; of the <i>Ephesiaca</i> is to
be attributed to an epitomizer, to its approach to the genre
of a popular tale, or to the author&rsquo;s own taste, the romance
is certainly characterized throughout by brevity, restraint
and sparcity of decoration. There are so few descriptions
that those of the festival of Artemis and of the canopy over
the marriage bed of Habrocomes and Anthia are notable.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a>
The action is too rapid and varied to allow time for decorative
passages. Instead of being set amid purple patches,
it is advanced by a kind of documentary evidence: two
oracles, two letters, one memorial and two votive inscriptions,
all directly quoted,<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> and a reference to an inscription
finally offered as a votive in the Artemesion by Habrocomes
and Anthia giving an account of all their adventures.</p>
<p>Inset narratives, those stories within stories which make
pleasing digressions in other longer romances, are here
very few. Hippothoos recounts his love for the beautiful
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
Hyperanthes and the boy&rsquo;s untimely drowning.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> Aegialeus,
the Spartan living with the mummy of his wife, tells
how his love for her has outlasted death.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> Both these
narratives are colorful, dramatic and poignant from the
very qualities which characterize all the romance. These
are brevity, sincerity and restrained emotion.</p>
<p>The influence of Chariton is clearly seen in Xenophon
both in direct imitation and in qualities of style. When
the Phoenician pirates had kidnapped Habrocomes and
Anthia on their trireme and fired their captives&rsquo; vessel
leaving many to perish in the sea, an old slave, as he swam,
pitifully called to Habrocomes to save his aged paedagogue
or at least kill him and bury him.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> In view of the situation
this is a ridiculous appeal, but it is a clear imitation of
a passage in Chariton where, when Chaereas resolves to go
to sea to search for Callirhoe, his father Ariston begs his
son not to desert him, but to take him on his trireme,<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a>
or to wait a few days for his father&rsquo;s death and burial.
Anthia, when Manto, the daughter of the brigand chief,
demands Habrocomes&rsquo; submission to her passion, begs her
husband to save his life in this way and swears that she will
leave him free by killing herself, only asking from him
burial, one last kiss, and a place in his memory. This is
in direct imitation of Chariton and of Chaereas&rsquo; words
when he finds Callirhoe married to Dionysius.<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> Here
Xenophon is simpler than his model, for he does not transfer
the effective lines from Homer which Chariton quotes.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a>
The burial of Anthia with its rich funeral gifts resembles
the burial of Callirhoe and also the lavish equipment of
the cenotaph for Chaereas.<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a> The language of Chariton
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
is adapted for the lament of Habrocomes in Italy at the
failure of his quest and his renewed pledge of faithfulness
unto death.<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a></p>
<p>These clear indications of imitation of detail serve to
corroborate the evidence of general imitation of style. Indeed
Dalmeyda sees in the whole temperament of Xenophon
a close affinity to Chariton. Xenophon introduces
the most startling events without fanfare. Characteristic
of his style are accumulated questions, pathetic r&eacute;sum&eacute;s,
oaths, invocations of the gods, apostrophes of men and of
things particularly of that fatal beauty which the young
hero and heroine deplore because of their misery. Xenophon&rsquo;s
relation to Chariton in all this is striking.<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a></p>
<p>The plot of the novel has seemed to some critics epic
in its chronological narrative of successive adventures.
Others find the structure a tragic plot with an angry god
demanding satisfaction for the sin of arrogance and the
guilty hero involving in his own nemesis the one most
dear to him. It is true that this and other resemblances
to tragedy exist. The story of Manto and her false denunciation
of Habrocomes for an attempt to rape her
after she has failed to win his love goes back to the Phaedra
story of Euripides&rsquo; <i>Hippolytus</i>. The noble goatherd husband
of Anthia finds his prototype in Electra&rsquo;s peasant
husband in Euripides&rsquo; play. The scene where Anthia on
her wedding-night takes poison which proves to be a sleeping
potion, to avoid a new marriage and keep her troth to
her lost love seems to be the antecedent of the poison scene
in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</p>
<p>To me, however, this novelette finds its closest affiliation
in another successor. Both the structure and the devices
used to arouse emotion anticipate the modern cinema.
This contemporary form of amusement is such an accepted
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
part of modern life that we hardly need to read the books
about the cinema by Allerdyce Nicoll, Lewis Jacobs, Maurice
Bard&egrave;che and others to understand &ldquo;the Rise of the
American Film.&rdquo; Personally I go to the movies to escape
from routine and from painful thoughts of our own times.
Occasionally I allow myself to be educated about <i>Steel</i> or
<i>The River</i>. I prefer to industrial films or films of social
problems like lynching, prison conditions, housing, films
with biographies of great historical characters: Pasteur,
Zola, Rembrandt. I like films set in local history such as
<i>Maryland</i> or <i>Kentucky</i> or <i>Gone with the Wind</i> or <i>The
Howards of Virginia</i> or <i>The North West Mounted Police</i>.
I have to shut my eyes during the fighting and the cruelties
of <i>Sea Hawk</i> and <i>All This and Heaven Too</i>. But I like
the cinematic rapidity of changes of scene, the control by
the camera of space and magnitude, the extension of the
time-limit, the fade-ins and fade-outs which can create fantastic
visions, the value of the flash-back to recall what has
been already seen, the concentration of interest achieved
by close-ups.</p>
<p>Many of these devices I recognize in the Greek Romances
and especially in Xenophon of Ephesus. His narrative is
as condensed as that of a scenario with lacunae, abrupt
transitions, failures in an adequate vocabulary of emotion.
The local history of Ephesus is emphasized and depicted.
Scenes shift with cinematic rapidity. Hair-raising adventures
succeed each other at an exciting pace. Bandits and
pirates achieve robbery and kidnapping. High police officials
or officers like G-Men perform valiant rescues.
Court-room scenes as in many films vie with shipwrecks in
interest. Documents like letters are presented to the reader&rsquo;s
eye as on the screen. Visions and dreams are made to
seem as real as in fade-ins and fade-outs.</p>
<p>There is a clear morality in the opposition of good and
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
bad characters and in the final victory of the good. Hero
and heroine captivate by their extraordinary beauty and
maintain their chastity and fidelity against terrific odds.
Hence their phenomenal virtue is rewarded by reunion in
the end. Religion often plays a saving part (as on the
screen for example in <i>Brother Orchid</i>). The Reader like
the audience at the movie goes away with a sense of having
been enlivened, entertained and vastly improved. For
the function of the Greek romance in the second and third
centuries <span class="small">A.D.</span>, when the universal rule of the Roman Empire
gave scant scope for great oratory or tragedy under
the blessings of an enforced peace, was to entertain and to
edify. The Greek romance substituted for the adventures
of the mind new themes: the excitements of passion, the
interests of travel, and the consolations of religion. It was
lifted out of the ranks of the trivial and the second-rate by
its great central theme: that there is such a thing as true
love; that weighed in the balance against it all the world
is nothing; and that it outlives time and even death.</p>
<p>Our own age in America, bleeding internally from the
agony of a war which it is powerless to end, fearful for its
own menaced security, demands from the cinema not only
temporary oblivion and excitement, but encouragement
to believe that love lasts even unto death, that heroes ride
again and are victorious, and that finally, by the help of
God, the right will conquer.</p>

<h2 id="c4">IV
<br /><i>THE</i> AETHIOPICA <i>OF HELIODORUS</i></h2>
<p>The life of Heliodorus is as obscure as that of each of the
other writers of Greek romance, but in the tradition of
his there is a special point of controversy. Was Heliodorus
a pagan novelist or a Christian bishop? Or by some
strange metamorphosis did the writer of the romantic
<i>Aethiopica</i> become in later and staider years the Bishop of
Tricca? The only certain facts are found in the autobiographical
sentence which concludes the romance, that he
was a Phoenician of Emesa, of a family descended from
Helios, the son of Theodosius.</p>
<p>It was Socrates who, in the fifth century <span class="small">A.D.</span>, stated that
the custom of celibacy for the clergy was introduced in
Thessaly by Heliodorus when he became bishop of Tricca.
He added that Heliodorus wrote in his youth a love-story,
which he called <i>Aethiopica</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> Photius in the ninth century
says that he received the bishopric later, that is after
writing the romance. Nicephorus Callistus in the fourteenth
century after quoting the remark of Socrates adds
that the <i>Aethiopica</i> created such a scandal Heliodorus had
to choose between his bishopric and the destruction of his
romance so he abandoned his charge, but this is probably
mere embellishment of the story. As Rattenbury points
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
out,<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> neither Socrates, Photius nor Nicephorus declares
that Heliodorus was a Christian when he wrote his romance,
but they imply clearly that he became a bishop afterwards.
And if the author of the romance was a devout
pagan as he seems to have been, that state of mind could
have made possible his conversion to Christianity. This
seems a reasonable explanation of the strong tradition continuing
from the fifth century that Heliodorus became
bishop of Tricca.</p>
<p>As to his date, there are some certainties but no exactitude.
The Bishop of Tricca must have lived before Socrates
wrote his <i>Historia Ecclesiastica</i> which covered the
period 306-439. There is no external evidence on the
time of the writer of the romance, but from the general
conclusions about the dating of the Greek Romances, he
probably wrote not later than the end of the third century.
His native city Emesa was the birthplace of two Roman
Emperors, Heliogabalus (218-222) and Alexander Severus
(222-235). About the middle of the century Emesa was
conquered by Zenobia of Palmyra, but was freed by Aurelian
in 272. Heliodorus may have written in its most flourishing
period, 220-240. It is generally agreed that Heliodorus
is later than Chariton who could not have written
after 150 and earlier than Achilles Tatius who wrote about
the beginning of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Rattenbury thinks that a possible reconstruction of
Heliodorus&rsquo; life is this. He was born in Emesa in Phoenician
Syria. His family was connected with the cult of the
Sun. In his youth, perhaps between 220 and 240, he wrote
a romance in which the influence of the cult of Helios
appears, also the neo-Pythagoreanism of Apollonius of
Tyana. It is not impossible that finally he was converted
to Christianity, became bishop of Tricca and in that office
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
introduced in his diocese celibacy for the clergy.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> Calderini
has shown with discrimination and perspicacity
that the special characteristic of the <i>Aethiopica</i> is the interest
in philosophy which distinguishes it and its author
from Chariton, the writer of historical romance, and from
Achilles Tatius, the writer of romance tinged with science.<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a>
A study of the <i>Aethiopica</i> itself will show how
deeply infused the novel is with this religious philosophical
coloring.</p>
<p>Before outlining the narrative, I will give as usual a list
of the principal characters. These are:</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The opening scene of the romance is startling and mysterious.
In Egypt, from a mountain near the mouth of
the Nile a band of pirates get a view of the seashore. They
behold a heavily laden ship without a crew, a plain strewn
with dead bodies and the remains of an ill-fated banquet.
A wounded youth is lying on the ground. He is being
cared for by a beautiful young woman dressed in a religious
garb which makes her seem a priestess or a goddess,
Diana or Isis. Indeed a divine effulgence emanates from
her. The pirates though at first overawed descend and
collect rich booty. Their captain then courteously conveys
the maiden and the youth to their pirate home. This
was called &ldquo;The Pasture&rdquo; and was a sort of island in a delta
of the Nile. Some of the pirates lived in huts made of
reeds, some in boats. The water was their fortification.
Their streets were winding water-ways cut through the
reeds.</p>
<p>The pirate chief assigned the care of his two captives to
a young Greek, Cnemon, who was his interpreter. The
prisoners were overjoyed on finding their custodian a
Greek. He promised to heal the wounds of Theagenes,
who had now revealed his own name and that of Chariclea,
and on their urgent request, he told him his own story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;am the son of Aristippus, an Athenian.
After my brother&rsquo;s death, my father married again a
woman named Demaeneta, who was a mischief-maker.
Like Phaedra she fell in love with me, her step-son, indeed
called me her dear Hippolytus. When I repelled her advances
she accused me to my father of attempted rape. He
had me scourged. Worse than that, Thisbe, the maid of
Demaeneta, on her mistress&rsquo; orders involved me in an
amorous intrigue with herself and later promised to show
me my step-mother with an adulterer. Sword in hand I
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
followed her to the bed-room and just as I was about to
murder her paramour, I found he was my father. Aristippus
charged me in court with attempted parricide.
Only a divided vote spared my life and sent me into exile.
Lately I received news that my father through Thisbe had
found out his wife&rsquo;s corruption; she had killed herself;
and now Aristippus is trying to obtain from the people his
son&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Thyamis the pirate leader although he
was warned in a dream that having Chariclea, he would
not have her, announced to his band his intention of
marrying her. She pretended to consent, but asked that
their marriage be postponed until they reached Memphis
so that there she could resign her priesthood of Diana.
Thyamis accepted this condition. Theagenes was horrified
until Chariclea explained that this agreement was
made only to secure more time for their plans for safety.
A hostile band of brigands was now seen approaching.
Thyamis had Cnemon hide Chariclea in a secret cave.
When the terrible battle began to go against him, Thyamis
rushed back to the cave and killed a woman in the dark
whom he believed Chariclea. In battle he was then taken
alive. The victorious brigands fired the huts on the island
but did not find the cave. Cnemon and Theagenes,
who had escaped in little boats, returned to the island.
When Cnemon conducted Theagenes to the cave by its
secret entrance, they found in its dark gloom the body of
a dead woman. Theagenes believing it Chariclea burst
into lamentation and planned suicide. But Cnemon took
away his sword, got a torch lighted and found that the
woman was Thisbe and in her dead hand was a letter.
They soon found Chariclea alive.</p>
<p>After the first joy of reunion Chariclea wished to know
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
who the dead woman was. Cnemon revealed that she was
Thisbe and related all her story: how after her plot
against him, Arsinoe, a rival courtesan whose lover Nausicles
she had stolen, revealed Thisbe&rsquo;s machinations against
Demaeneta; how Cnemon&rsquo;s father was exiled on the
ground of complicity and Thisbe fled. The letter in
Thisbe&rsquo;s hand proved to be to Cnemon, a petition to save
her from the pirates who had stolen her. Just then Thermuthis,
her pirate captor, arrived to reclaim her, only to
find her dead. The sword in her wound proved to him
that she was slain by Thyamis.</p>
<p>Theagenes and Chariclea, Cnemon and Thermuthis
now started out in separate pairs towards Chemmis, a rich
city on the Nile, to get food. The menace of Thermuthis
was conveniently removed as he died from the bite of an
asp. Near Chemmis Cnemon met an old man who entertained
him at his home. He proved to be Calasiris, the
foster-father of Theagenes and Chariclea. This he revealed
to Cnemon in a long narrative of his own life: how
though a priest of Isis he had gone into voluntary exile to
break off the wiles of a courtesan; how he had sojourned
at Delphi, attending the ceremonies and talking with the
philosophers. One, Charicles, related how in his own
travels in Egypt he had had intrusted to him by an Ethiopian
merchant a beautiful child. The merchant had
found her exposed with a bag of jewels and an inscribed
fillet. These too he gave to Charicles making him promise
to guard her freedom and wed her to a free man. He
had named her Chariclea and brought her up in Greece
but now, though she was very beautiful, she refused to
marry.</p>
<p>Calasiris also described to Cnemon the sacrifice to Neoptolemus
offered by the Aenianians and the Delphic oracle
which he had heard there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Delphians, regard with reverential care,</p>
<p class="t0">Both him the goddess-born, and her the fair;</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Grace</i>&rdquo; is the sound which ushers in her name,</p>
<p class="t0">The syllable wherewith it ends, is &ldquo;<i>Fame</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">They both my fane shall leave, and oceans past,</p>
<p class="t0">In regions torrid shall arrive at last;</p>
<p class="t0">There shall the gods reward their pious vows,</p>
<p class="t0">And snowy chaplets bind their dusky brows.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Calasiris at the urgent request of Cnemon described all
the ceremonies attendant on the sacrifice to Neoptolemus:
the hecatomb and the other victims, the Thracian
maidens bearing offerings, the hymn to the Hero, the
dance, the procession of the fifty armed horsemen led by
Theagenes, the radiant appearance of Chariclea in a chariot.
All this description was the brilliant setting for the
meeting of Theagenes and Chariclea, for when Theagenes
took from the priestess&rsquo; hand the torch to light the sacrificial
pyre, in them both the flame of first love was kindled.</p>
<p>The next day Chariclea lay abed very ill in her apartment
in the temple. Calasiris feared it was due to &ldquo;<i>fascinatio</i>.&rdquo;
Calasiris after meeting Theagenes had a vision
in which Apollo and Diana consigned Theagenes and
Chariclea to his care and bade him take them to Egypt.
The next morning Theagenes confessed to Calasiris his
love and besought his aid. Charicles begged him to heal
his daughter. This enabled him to talk to her.</p>
<p>Chariclea recovered sufficiently the next day to attend
the contest of the men in armor and to award the palm to
the victor, Theagenes. But her passion and her illness
increased after this second meeting and Calasiris was
again summoned to treat her. Her disease was diagnosed
as love and Calasiris persuaded her father to let him see
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the fillet found with the exposed baby. Calasiris was able
to read the inscription on it. It was a letter from her
mother, Persinna, queen of the Ethiopians, revealing that
she had borne a white daughter because at her conception
she had been looking at a picture of Andromeda; then
fearing the charge of adultery she had exposed her baby
with the fillet and the jewels. All this Calasiris told to
Chariclea. Calasiris then made a plot with her by which
she was to pretend to become affianced to Alcamenes, the
nephew of Charicles, as her foster-father wished. Charicles
was delighted although he was nervous because of a
dream in which an eagle from the hand of Apollo bore his
daughter away. He gave her all the jewels.</p>
<p>Then Calasiris persuaded some Phoenician merchants
to take him and two friends on their ship as far as Sicily;
and he ordered Theagenes and his young friends to kidnap
Chariclea. She consented to the plan after Theagenes
had bound himself by an oath never to force her love.
After they were off, Charicles roused the city to pursuit of
them. Calasiris after telling of the arrival of the Phoenician
ship at Zacynthos interrupted his narrative to rest.
Nausicles returned to the house and unknown to the others
had brought Chariclea with him.</p>
<p>(Here the author himself gave a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the adventures
of Theagenes and Chariclea from the time they
parted with Cnemon. In the cave the lovers had a long
talk and made an agreement as to what they would do in
case fortune again separated them: they would inscribe
on temple, statue, herm or boundary stone, Theagenes
the name Pythicus, Chariclea Pythias; the direction in
which each departed; to what place or people; also the
time of writing. For recognition if they met disguised
they decided to use as signs Chariclea&rsquo;s ring and Theagenes&rsquo;
scar from a boar. Their watchwords were to be a
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
lamp for her, a palm-tree for him. They sealed this covenant
in kisses, then left the cave taking Chariclea&rsquo;s sacred
robes, her bow and quiver and her jewels.</p>
<p>Soon they met an armed band and were taken prisoners.
The commander was Mithranes, an officer of Oroondates,
viceroy of Egypt. Nausicles had persuaded him for pay
to make this expedition to the island in search of his
Thisbe. Nausicles on seeing Theagenes and Chariclea
cleverly pretended that Chariclea was Thisbe, the object
of his quest. Mithranes demanded Theagenes as his prize
and despatched him to Oroondates as a fine youth for service
with the Great King.)</p>
<p>The next day Calasiris and Cnemon heard all Nausicles&rsquo;
story from himself, saw Chariclea and made a plan to ransom
Theagenes. After Nausicles had celebrated a sacrifice
in the temple of Hermes, the god of gain, Calasiris on
request continued his narrative of the voyage from Delphi.
At Zacynthos a deaf old fisherman Tyrrhenus gave them
lodging. The Tyrian merchant who won the victory at
the Pythian games now sued for Chariclea&rsquo;s hand. Tyrrhenus
discovered an ambush of pirates waiting for the
Phoenician ship to sail. Calasiris without revealing this
persuaded the Tyrian captain to sail that night. The pirate
crew under Trachinus pursued them and engaged
them in a terrible battle so finally the Phoenicians had to
surrender. Trachinus demanded marriage with Chariclea
and she deceitfully promised her hand if he would
spare Calasiris and &ldquo;her brother&rdquo; Theagenes. With difficulty
the pirates maneuvered the boat to land near the
mouth of the Nile. Trachinus told Calasiris that he proposed
to marry Chariclea that day. Calasiris, ingenious as
ever, persuaded him to let Chariclea go on the ship to attire
herself for the wedding and be left undisturbed there.
Calasiris then plotted with Pelorus, second in command of
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
the pirates, telling him Chariclea loved him. Pelorus
since he had been the first to board the Phoenician ship
demanded, as his right of first choice of the booty, the girl.
A terrible battle ensued in which Trachinus was killed,
Pelorus wounded by Theagenes and put to flight and Theagenes
badly wounded. In the morning Egyptian pirates
arrived and carried them both off. Calasiris had spent his
days mourning for them until this present recovery of
Chariclea.</p>
<p>The next day Calasiris, Cnemon and Nausicles set out
to find Theagenes. An acquaintance informed Nausicles
that Mithranes had sent his troops on an expedition against
the men of Bessa, commanded by Thyamis, because they
had stolen a captive Greek youth. So Nausicles and his
friends returned to Chemmis and told all to Chariclea.
Nausicles gave a farewell dinner-party since the season favorable
for navigation compelled him to sail for Greece.
Cnemon after a struggle with himself decided to go with
him and was permitted to marry his daughter, Nausiclea.</p>
<p>Calasiris and Chariclea disguised as beggars started for
Bessa to seek Theagenes. Near Bessa they found many
corpses lying on the ground. An old woman told them
there had been a battle between Mithranes&rsquo; forces and the
men of Bessa in which the men of Bessa had been victorious
and Mithranes had been killed. The victors had now
set out to Memphis against Oroondates. The old woman
had lost her son in battle. That night Calasiris and Chariclea
secretly watched her magic rites by which she raised
him to give her news of her other son. The shade also
revealed that there were two witnesses to her wicked necromancy;
that Chariclea should be happily reunited with
Theagenes and that his own mother would meet her death
by the sword. This soon happened, for she fell on an upright
sword on the battle-field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Calasiris and Chariclea arrived at Memphis just as
Thyamis and his brigands began a siege of it. The people
of Memphis in the absence of Oroondates consulted the
queen Arsace about the wisdom of going out to attack the
enemy. Thyamis had been driven into exile by the slanders
of his brother Petosiris who swore there was an amour
between Thyamis and Arsace. Petosiris had then succeeded
his brother in the priesthood of Isis. Arsace after
looking at the enemy from the wall ordered a single combat
between Thyamis and Petosiris to decide the war. In
this combat Petosiris was forced to flee. As he was running
around the city walls the third time, Calasiris arrived
and saw the combat between his two sons that an oracle
had foretold. Rushing between them he ended the contest.</p>
<p>Chariclea discovered Theagenes and suddenly threw
her arms about him. Her hero disgusted at her beggar&rsquo;s
rags threw her off and did not recognize her until she
whispered: &ldquo;Pythias, have you forgotten the torch?&rdquo;
Then he took her to his arms, while Arsace and the other
watchers on the wall marvelled at the scene as though it
were on the stage. So peace was made by the father and
the lovers were reunited. All went to the temple of Isis.
Calasiris restored his son Thyamis to the priesthood.</p>
<p>Arsace had fallen madly in love with Theagenes on seeing
him twice and confided this to her aged maid, Cybele.
This maid on going to the temple of Isis to offer prayers for
her mistress learned that Calasiris had died there during
the night and that no one except the priests could enter the
temple for seven days on account of the funeral rites.
Thereupon Cybele craftily secured permission to entertain
the two young Greeks who were staying there in
Arsace&rsquo;s palace and took them home. When they found
that they were in the palace, they became suspicious for
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
they had noticed the queen&rsquo;s interest in Theagenes the day
before. So at Chariclea&rsquo;s suggestion, Theagenes said they
were brother and sister. Cybele went to Arsace&rsquo;s apartment
to tell her all, locking the guests in their room. In
her absence, her son Achaemenes came home, listened at
their door and from their talk and from a glimpse at Theagenes
realized that this was the very youth who had been
taken from him by Thyamis.</p>
<p>As the days passed, Arsace tried to win the love of Theagenes
first through subtle allurement, then through open
confession of her passion and at last through domination.
Achaemenes finally told Arsace who they were so the queen
informed Theagenes that they were now her slaves as they
had been the captive slaves of Mithranes and he must obey
her. Then in the presence of Cybele Theagenes promised
himself to Arsace on condition that she would never
give Chariclea to Achaemenes, who had demanded her.
He confessed that Chariclea was not his sister but his
fianc&eacute;e. On hearing this Achaemenes rode away to inform
Oroondates of all.</p>
<p>Oroondates was engaged in a campaign against Hydaspes,
King of the Ethiopians, who had got possession of
Philae. On hearing Achaemenes&rsquo; report Oroondates despatched
his eunuch Bagoas with fifty horsemen to Memphis
to bring Theagenes and Chariclea to his camp. He
sent two letters to this effect to Arsace and to his chief
eunuch. Achaemenes he kept with himself.</p>
<p>In Memphis Thyamis had been unable to procure the
release of the young Greeks from Arsace. Moreover the
frustrated queen had begun to try imprisonment and
torture on Theagenes. When he was still obstinate, Cybele
advised getting rid of Chariclea to free his heart and
she prepared to poison the girl. Fortunately a maid exchanged
the goblets. Cybele herself drank the poison
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
and expired, but with her last breath she declared Chariclea
had murdered her. So Arsace threw the girl into the
prison where Theagenes was and had her tried. In the
court-room Chariclea pleaded guilty, for this was the plan
that she and her lover had agreed on in the prison, that
they might die together. The Supreme Council ordered
that she be burned alive. Chariclea was saved by a miracle,
for the flames on the pyre refused to touch her person.
Arsace then consigned her again to prison on the
ground that she was a witch.</p>
<p>In prison, Chariclea and Theagenes had a long talk
about the dream-visions they had each seen. To each
Calasiris had appeared and given a metrical prophecy.
To Chariclea he had said:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bearing Pantarb&egrave;, fear not flames, fair maid,</p>
<p class="t0">Fate, to whom naught is hard, shall bring thee aid.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And to Theagenes:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From Arsace, the morrow sets thee free&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">To Aethiopia with the virgin flee.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Chariclea interpreted these oracles to mean that her jewel,
the Pantarb&egrave;, was protecting her; and that on the next
day they would be freed from Arsace and go to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bagoas arrived at Memphis and Euphrates
on receiving the letter of Oroondates sent Theagenes and
Chariclea off secretly with Bagoas. On their journey they
received first the news that Arsace had killed herself and
second that Oroondates had gone to Syene. Later on the
way they were seized by a band of Troglodite Ethiopians
who took Bagoas and the two Greeks to their king, Hydaspes.
He planned to save them as victims to be sacrificed
to the gods.</p>
<p>Hydaspes was besieging Syene. Oroondates had got inside
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the city before the blockade and was directing the
defense. But Hydaspes used a new weapon against him,
inundation. His army dug a great trench around Syene
with earth-works encircling it. This trench he connected
with the river Nile by a long canal, fifty feet wide, banked
by high walls. When the works were finished, he cut
away the embankment between his canal and the Nile
and let the river in. Syene became an island city and
the pressure of the water on the walls threatened inundation.
So Oroondates and the people of Syene had to sue
for peace. This was granted, and Hydaspes built up again
the embankment between his canal and the Nile and proceeded
to drain off the water.</p>
<p>During the festival of the overflowing of the Nile Oroondates
and his army slipped away in the night, bridging the
mud swamps about Syene by planks, and went to Elephantine,
which revolted with him against Hydaspes. In the
new battle Hydaspes was again victorious and took Oroondates
prisoner, but the Ethiopian was a generous conqueror
and sent Oroondates back to be again viceroy of his province.</p>
<p>Hydaspes on his way home stopped two days at Philae
and from there sent home letters announcing his victory
to Persinna and the Gymnosophists. Persinna recalled a
dream that she had brought forth a full-grown daughter
and interpreted the daughter as this victory. The people
assembled for the celebration at the island city of Meroe
and according to their traditions demanded human sacrifice
of foreign captives of war. The prisoners now underwent
the test of chastity by ascending the altar of fire and
of course Theagenes and Chariclea passed the test.</p>
<p>The Gymnosophists through their leader Sisimithres
refused to witness human sacrifice and foretold that this
one would never be consummated. Chariclea begged
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
them to stay and hear her case. (She had recognized Sisimithres&rsquo;
name as that of the one who had given her to
Charicles at Catadupa). Chariclea declared that she was
a native, not a foreigner, and produced her fillet and her
jewels, among them the mystic ring, Pantarb&eacute;. Sisimithres
narrated his part in her story. Hydaspes was puzzled over
how he could have a <i>white</i> child, but Sisimithres explained
that Persinna at the time of conception had fixed her eyes
on a picture of the naked, white Andromeda. When the
picture was brought in as evidence, Chariclea&rsquo;s resemblance
to its Andromeda was found startling. Moreover
a birthmark of a black ring around Chariclea&rsquo;s arm attested
her black blood.</p>
<p>The people now refused to have Chariclea sacrificed,
but the fate of Theagenes still hung in the balance. Chariclea
begged that if he were to be sacrificed, she might perform
the deed. (Apparently she planned to carry out
a kind of suicide pact.) Hydaspes thought his daughter
was insane and sent her into a tent with her mother while
he received ambassadors and their gifts of victory. His
nephew Meroebus brought a mighty athlete. Hydaspes
as a joke gave him in return an elephant, but also promised
him the hand of Chariclea. The Axiomitae presented a
giraffe, an animal so strange that it terrified some of the
natives. Moreover, one bull and two horses broke their
fetters and dashed madly around the inside of the circle
of guards. Theagenes mounted another horse, pursued
the bull, wore it out and finally downed it. The enchanted
spectators now demanded that he be matched
with the champion Meroebus. Him too he vanquished.
Oroondates crowned Theagenes as victor, but nevertheless
prepared to sacrifice him.</p>
<p>At that moment ambassadors from Syene arrived with
a letter from Oroondates. He begged that a young woman
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
captive be sent to him with her father who was one of the
ambassadors. This was Charicles. He recognized Theagenes
and accused him of having stolen his daughter at
Delphi. Theagenes revealed that Chariclea was the one
demanded. Sisimithres told the rest of the story. Chariclea
rushing out of the tent begged Charicles to forgive
her elopement. Persinna told Hydaspes that she had
learned that Chariclea was betrothed to Theagenes.</p>
<p>Sisimithres speaking not in Greek but in Ethiopian for
all the people to hear ordered Hydaspes to submit to the
will of the gods who had saved the two young lovers and
who did not approve of human sacrifice and exhorted him
to end human sacrifices forever. So Hydaspes asked the
people to observe the will of the gods and to sanction the
marriage of Theagenes and Chariclea. This they did.
Then Hydaspes consecrated the two as priest and priestess
of the Sun and the Moon and on their heads he placed the
mitres which he and Persinna had worn as symbols of their
offices. Thus was fulfilled the oracle:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In regions torrid shall arrive at last;</p>
<p class="t0">There shall the gods reward their pious vows,</p>
<p class="t0">And snowy chaplets bind their dusky brows.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then a great procession escorted them to Meroe there to
fulfill the more mystic parts of wedlock.</p>
<p>In this brief re-telling of Heliodorus&rsquo; long story, certain
striking features of his structure appear. Geography and
ethnography are important as in the other novelists. The
eastern basin of the Mediterranean is the center of the
adventures, the district which for centuries was the scene
of the conflict for power between many nations. As in
Xenophon, many geographical details are given, often with
little accuracy.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a> As Maillon points out, imagination and
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
fantasy falsify the historical and geographical allusions.
Heliodorus gathers everything that can satisfy the taste
for the strange and the marvellous. At a time when the
critical spirit was so little developed in the historians, a
writer of romance would naturally produce marvellous
narratives and vague descriptions. Heliodorus confuses
the Ethiopia of Herodotus with that of the Ptolemies and
imagines an Ethiopian empire which did not exist during
the domination of Egypt by the Persians.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a> As in Chariton,
the superiority of the Greeks over the barbarians is
part of the author&rsquo;s faith.</p>
<p>In the development of the plot Heliodorus makes his
set more unified, less cinematic than Xenophon had done.
The scene of action lies almost entirely in Egypt with a
shift to Ethiopia for the final climax. This Egyptian set
is to be sure varied by different local scenes: the Nile,
an island village in its delta, towns such as Chemmis,
Memphis, Syene and Philae, the battle-fields of Bessa and
Elephantine, but nearly the whole plot develops in Egypt.
The exceptions are in the sub-plot presented in Cnemon&rsquo;s
narrative of his life-history which is laid in Athens, and
in Calasiris&rsquo; long account of his visit to Delphi. These
however are clearly set off as insets in the unity of the
Egyptian scene.</p>
<p>The plot itself is an original combination of epic and
dramatic structure. The other writers of Greek romance
begin at the beginning with a detailed account of the hero
and heroine, their family, their background. Heliodorus
in true epic style plunges us <i>in medias res</i> with his startling
opening scene of a seascape where a ship rides at anchor,
treasure-laden but not manned, where the shore is littered
with the remains of a banquet, but strewn with corpses,
where a young man lies wounded with a beautiful maiden
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
dressed as a goddess ministering to him. The reader is
as amazed and puzzled at the sight as are the pirates who
are peering down from the hills.</p>
<p>Another epic part of the structure is that the narrative
of events does not proceed in a straight line but zigzags
back and forth while a new arrival contributes his part to
the development of the plot, or the author himself gives
a retrospective r&eacute;sum&eacute; of past events to explain the present.
Calasiris&rsquo; long narrative is the best illustration of this resumptive
method but Cnemon, Achaemenes, Sisimithres
and Charicles all contribute their share of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> In
general, Heliodorus uses r&eacute;sum&eacute;s with great effect to clarify
his complicated plot. Sometimes he merely suggests a
summary of events (V. 16, 5); sometimes he gives a full
succinct recapitulation of events (II. 14, 1-2); sometimes
his heroes recount their adventures to complain of
them (V. 11).<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a></p>
<p>Many episodes too are taken from Homer. The games
in Delphi in honor of Apollo are indebted to those given
by Achilles in honor of Patroclus. The
<span title="teichoskopia" class="g">&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&chi;&omicron;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&pi;&#8055;&alpha;</span>
where Arsace on the wall of Memphis watches the combat in the
plain recalls Helen on the walls of Troy. The duel there
between Thyamis and Theagenes is like one of the Homeric
single combats. In it Theagenes&rsquo; pursuit of Thyamis
around the walls owes something to the pursuit of
Hector by the swift-footed Achilles. The scar of Theagenes
which is to be a sign of recognition was surely suggested
by Odysseus&rsquo;. The scene where the old woman
evokes her dead son on the field of battle imitates the Homeric
<span title="Nekyia" class="g">&Nu;&#8051;&kappa;&upsilon;&iota;&alpha;</span>.<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Even more prominent than his debt to epic poetry is
Heliodorus&rsquo; use of dramatic structure. All the usual devices
of Greek tragedy appear. Indeed the plot centers
on the recognition of the young Greek heroine as the white
Ethiopian princess by the tokens exposed with her in babyhood:
her jewels, her mystic ring, her lettered fillet. This
dramatic device of an agnorisis or recognition is multiplied
by Heliodorus for repeated situations: the recognition
of Chariclea in beggar&rsquo;s rags by Theagenes through
her watchword, the identification of Charicles as her foster-father
and of Sisimithres as the noble Greek who found
and saved the exposed child.</p>
<p>No less important is the usual Greek peripeteia, or reversal
of fortune, for hero and heroine are repeatedly reunited
only to be separated anew; together or separately
they are rescued from one catastrophe only to be plunged
into a worse danger. Calasiris&rsquo; long narrative resembles
not only the minstrel&rsquo;s songs at the court of Alcinous of
old far-off divine events, but also the messenger&rsquo;s speeches
in tragedy wherein events too horrible or too complicated
to be presented on the stage are told with a realism which
starts the imagination. The mechanism of a parallel subplot
is employed in Cnemon&rsquo;s life-story. The letter in
Thisbe&rsquo;s dead hand is indebted to Phaedra&rsquo;s in Euripides&rsquo;
<i>Hippolytus</i>. Cybele, Arsace&rsquo;s maid, owes much in her
character of confidant to Phaedra&rsquo;s nurse though she is
more cynical and familiar. The crowd takes the place
of the chorus, now demanding human sacrifice in the name
of tradition, now releasing Chariclea from it through pity,
now approving of the appeal of the noble Gymnosophists
in the name of the gods to abolish the immolation of
human victims. The <i>deus ex machina</i> is supplied by these
very gods of the Gymnosophists, Helios, the Sun, and Selene,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
the Moon, celestial symbols of pure deities of space
and time conceived in the philosophical mind.</p>
<p>Against this structure of drama the characters move as
though on a stage and even through the stylized formulae
of dramatic conventions usually attain individuality and
vitality. Maillon seems to me undiscriminating when he
speaks of them all as general types, not individuals, as
marionettes who can talk, lament and complain, but are
without life.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> Even characters that fall into general
groups may as in real life have distinguishing traits and
in the list of characters certain are unforgettable personalities.</p>
<p>The hero Theagenes is of course supremely handsome
and physically strong. He is also as Wolff says spectacularly
courageous but easily discouraged.<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> He has to be
kept from suicide by Cnemon. He has to be cheered by
Chariclea. And his Lady Fair is the resourceful partner
in emergencies who whispers to him &ldquo;Call me your Sister&rdquo;
or invents means of recognition in case of separation or
makes a plot to share with him his fate be it life or death.
She demands too when they start off on travels together
that her lover swear a sacred oath to respect her virginity.
Indeed her leadership deserves the tribute given Dido,
<i>dux femina facti</i>. As Calderini notes, cleverness and deception
were valued traits in those times and both she displayed.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a>
But she guarded her chastity even from her
dearest and her courage never failed. On the battle field
she can shoot her arrows. She is surrounded by a divine
aura of radiant beauty that illuminates her holy garb.</p>
<p>The real hero of the romance is her father, the Ethiopian
King Hydaspes, whose qualities she seemed to have inherited.
He is the type of the good king, but beyond that
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
he is very human. He has his humor so that when his
nephew presents him with a gigantic athletic champion
he smilingly gives him in exchange an elephant. He is
generous to a defeated foe, freeing Oroondates and restoring
him to his office so that the viceroy makes obeisance
to him and calls him the most just of mortals. He follows
tradition in preparing to offer to the gods foreign captives
as human victims, but when convinced by the Gymnosophists
of the inappropriateness of such sacrifice he leads
his people to the right decision about abolishing it and
happily crowns his daughter and her lover as new priests
of a purified worship.</p>
<p>Persinna his queen is a type of frustrated motherhood,
timid enough to expose at birth her beautiful white baby
for fear of the charge of adultery, but when her daughter
is restored to her she glows with ardent parentalism and
interprets Chariclea&rsquo;s wishes to her husband.</p>
<p>The characters in the sub-plot (Cnemon&rsquo;s story) are
less clearly delineated than those in the main narrative.
The story serves however not merely to introduce Thisbe,
who is useful for the main plot, but anticipates and prepares
for certain main characters. Aristippus the betrayed
husband, Demaeneta the wanton wife, Thisbe the
corrupt maid and Cnemon the coveted youth parallel
Oroondates, Arsace, Cybele and Theagenes himself.</p>
<p>The far east opens up before us under the shadow of the
Great King of the Persians. He never appears, but his
viceroys, their lieutenants, their eunuchs work his will
with the complete subservience which their act of obeisance
symbolizes. Oroondates is a good fighter, but he is ready
to desert secretly the city of Syene, which he has been defending,
before terms of surrender had been concluded, to
start another war in the name of the Great King. His
will conveyed by letters must be law to his eunuch or his
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
wife. This arbitrariness when imitated by his eunuch
Euphrates becomes sadistic tyranny over prisoners given
to his care.</p>
<p>Arsace his wife finds her escape in intrigue and amours.<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a>
Highly over-sexed she stops at nothing to satisfy her passion
as her wanton fancies shift from one desired lover to
another. She has no mercy for Theagenes when he is
obdurate or for Chariclea when she finds she is the object
of Theagenes&rsquo; affections.</p>
<p>Cybele her maid abets her machinations and her lust.
Though her position as confidante recalls Phaedra&rsquo;s nurse
in the <i>Hippolytus</i>, her character reproduces all the venality,
cunning and complaisance of the maids in new Attic
comedy. Torture and murder are natural tools for success
in her eyes and when she is hoist with her own petard,
she dies asserting that she has been poisoned by the innocent
girl whom she had hoped to make her victim. Arsace
with her Cybele is a complete foil for the purity and loyalty
of Chariclea.</p>
<p>The most interesting among the upright characters in
the play are the priests: Calasiris, high-priest of Isis in
Egypt, Charicles, priest of Apollo at Delphi, Sisimithres,
the Greek Gymnosophist. They are consecrated to service,
devoted to worship. They are men of the world extending
their knowledge by travel and talk. Calasiris on
his visit to Delphi spent his days in philosophical discussion
of religious rites and the meaning of the gods of Greece
and of Egypt. Charicles is a humanitarian who educates
the little waif Chariclea as his own daughter. Sisimithres
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
dares withdraw from the human sacrifices proposed by a
great king and people and by his personal authority converts
them from such abominable customs to a purer conception
of deity and of worship. Calasiris in his role of
interpreting the events of the story and solving its problems,
in his clear philosophical interests probably represents
Heliodorus himself.<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a></p>
<p>To return to the structure of the romance, the plot with
such borrowings from epic and dramatic poetry, with such
characters, some types, some highly individualized, moves
forward in a manner that resembles the modern cinema.
There is no carefully interwoven plot such as tragedy
presents, for example in <i>Oedipus Rex</i>. Rather there is
a progression of episodes, each a clear picture in itself, all
after many involutions and evolutions falling into an orderly
narrative. Rattenbury thinks that after Heliodorus&rsquo;
original beginning which secures the interest and sympathy
of the reader through his curiosity he fails to maintain
the interest throughout. The long retrospective narrative
of Calasiris becomes monotonous. The reader is
irritated by the postponement of the denouement after he
as well as the hero and heroine knows the secret of Chariclea&rsquo;s
parentage. Maillon, however, finds in Heliodorus
a great talent for narration. After the impressive opening
scene, he says, from narrative to narrative, from description
to description, one is led slowly but without ennui to
the grandeur of the final chapters. The variety of the
episodes does not detract from the unity of the narrative because
we keep returning to Theagenes and Chariclea in
whom we have been interested from the first.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a></p>
<p>To me personally the defects in the romance lie not in
the long narrative of Calasiris or in the early revelation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Chariclea&rsquo;s identity, but in the excessive use of descriptive
passages. Planned though they undoubtedly are to satisfy
the craving of the age for a knowledge of the novel and
the strange, or to give local color, they retard the development
of the story. Often they are prolix and difficult because
of an unfamiliar vocabulary and a complicated sentence
structure. There are many such passages: descriptions
of natural phenomena (the island city in the delta of
the Nile, the straits at Calydon); of curious animals (crocodile
and giraffe); of operations of war (a naval battle, the
siege of Syene, the duel of Thyamis and Petosiris); the
religious ceremonies at Delphi. These vary greatly in
clarity and effectiveness, but in general they tend to be
verbose and to retard the narrative. Such descriptions
are however one of the conventional features of the Greek
romance. And with all Heliodorus&rsquo; originality in plot,
in his tripartite structure of epic, dramatic and cinematic
features, he employs all the usual devices of Greek romance.
These are oracle and oath, r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, conversation
and rhetorical speeches, letters and soliloquies, meditated
suicide and apparent death, dreams and epiphanies.
But Heliodorus makes these conventional devices integral
parts of his plot.</p>
<p>The oracle given by the Pythian priestess at Delphi early
in the story motivates the plot until the very end when its
meaning is explained and its prophecy fulfilled. The oath
which Chariclea requires of her lover early in her travels
protects her chastity through all the intimacies of palace
apartment and prison dungeons. R&eacute;sum&eacute;s of events given
several times by Cnemon, by Calasiris in his long narrative,
by Charicles, clarify and facilitate the plot.<a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a> Conversation
is used constantly on the battle field or in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
boudoir, in palaces, in dungeons. Turn over the pages
of Heliodorus&rsquo; Greek as you would a modern novel and
test how often the pages are broken and enlivened by talk.
Rhetoric colors some of the longer speeches, but in the
court-room scene (the trial of Chariclea for poisoning Cybele)
the procedure is described but the speeches are not
quoted.</p>
<p>Letters are as important as oracles for the development
of the plot. The letter of Persinna inscribed on the fillet
exposed with her child furnishes the indisputable evidence
for the recognition of Chariclea. The letter in Thisbe&rsquo;s
dead hand is of prime importance in the sub-plot in announcing
to Cnemon the death of his wicked step-mother.
Business letters of Mithranes to Oroondates, of Oroondates
to Arsace and to the eunuch Euphrates, of Hydaspes to the
Supreme Council of Ethiopia and to his queen Persinna
furnish documentation for the march of events. The
letter of Oroondates to Hydaspes in the last book prepares
the way for Charicles&rsquo; final explanation of his relation
to his foster-daughter and his own recognition of
Chariclea.</p>
<p>Soliloquies reveal emotional states and meditated suicide.
At Chemmis one night Chariclea left alone yields
to despair and vows that if she learns Theagenes is dead,
she will join him in the shades. An apparent death nearly
precipitates tragedy when in the dark of the cave the body
of Thisbe is mistaken for that of Chariclea. Theagenes
bursts into despairing lamentation and proposes suicide.
But Cnemon foreseeing this has filched his sword and
presently the light of Cnemon&rsquo;s torch reveals the truth
and there ensues a happy reversal of fortune.</p>
<p>Among all these usual features of the plot a new importance
is given to dreams and epiphanies. They are
peculiarly significant because of their bearing on Heliodorus&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
philosophical and religious interests. Some motivate
minor events or simply create atmosphere. Thyamis
in the night before the battle with another band of brigands
had a vision of Isis who gave Chariclea to him with
the mystic words: &ldquo;Having her, you will not have her,
but you will be unjust and will kill the stranger. And
she will not be killed.&rdquo; At first Thyamis, interpreting
the dream in accordance with his own wishes, thought it
meant that he would murder her virginity, but she would
live. Then when the battle went against him, he changed
his interpretation and to save Chariclea from his foes,
killed her (as he thought) in the cave. So Thisbe&rsquo;s death
is explained. Another dream of little importance is Chariclea&rsquo;s
in which a wild looking man appeared and pierced
her right eye with his sword. Opposing interpretations
are given by Theagenes and Cnemon. The epiphanies,
however, which are vitally significant for the plot all foretell
the final fortunes of the hero and the heroine. To
Calasiris Apollo and Diana appeared, the god leading
Theagenes, the goddess Chariclea, and intrusted them
to him. Diana too bade him consider the pair as his
children and take them to Egypt when and how the gods
should decree. Charicles too dreamed that an eagle flew
from the hand of Apollo, seized Chariclea and bore her
away from Delphi to a land of dark forms. Calasiris again
had a vision, this time of Odysseus, the great traveller, who
demanded sacrifices and presented Penelope&rsquo;s blessing on
Chariclea. Calasiris after his death himself appeared
simultaneously to Chariclea and Theagenes, telling the
heroine that the Pantarb&egrave; jewel would protect her, and
telling the hero that he would be freed from Arsace and
take his Lady to Ethiopia. Hydaspes, when the prisoner
Chariclea is brought before him, recalled a dream that a
full-grown daughter was born to him and the face of this
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
dream-girl was Chariclea&rsquo;s. This prepared him for the
real recognition of her identity. Now the validity of these
apparitions is sometimes questioned: are they dreams or
visions? The author comments that desire often prompts
favorable interpretation. He has Hydaspes&rsquo; officers tell
him that the mind creates for itself fantasies which seem
to foretell future events. He has the optimistic Chariclea
encourage Theagenes to trust in the gods and interpret
Calasiris&rsquo; prophecies as beneficent. But all the same
Heliodorus motivates his plot by this popular belief in
dreams and epiphanies.</p>
<p>This structural element fits in with the religious-philosophical
coloring of the whole background. Dreams
and epiphanies, miracles and necromancy are partial manifestations
of a deep-seated interest in cults and philosophies
that is a phenomenon of the times. There is a long description
of the festival of Neoptolemus at Delphi with
its pageantry, sacrifices, hymn, dance, libations and the
lighting of the pyre. It is here that Theagenes and Chariclea
meet and at first sight fall in love. Nausicles the
merchant must sacrifice to Hermes, god of trade. The
festival of the overflowing of the Nile is celebrated in
Egypt. And among the Ethiopians the first fruits of victory
in war are offered in the form of sacrifice of human
captives to their gods. The most prominent cults are
those of Apollo-Helios of Delphi, Egypt and Ethiopia and
of the Egyptian Isis. These are savior gods to whom
mortals offer petitions for salvation.</p>
<p>Opinions differ as to whether the representation of the
cult of Helios is the usual conventional religious background
of a Greek romance or whether it is the author&rsquo;s
glorification of the cult of his native city with which he
and his family had some official connection. At the antipodes
in criticism are Rattenbury who perceives only the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
usual religious conventions and Calderini who thinks the
unique feature of the <i>Aethiopica</i> is its rich philosophical
coloring.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> All would agree on marked influence in Heliodorus
of Neo-Pythagoreanism and the teachings of Apollonius
of Tyana as recorded by Philostratus.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> Maillon
in his preface gives this discriminating summary of his
own position towards Heliodorus&rsquo; philosophical interests.
He says that the Pantheon of Heliodorus does
not contain many deities. He refers to the gods under the Neo-Pythagorean name of
<span title="hoi kreittones" class="g">&omicron;&#7985; &kappa;&rho;&epsilon;&#8055;&tau;&tau;&omicron;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>.
Calasiris whose role is most important may well represent the author&rsquo;s
state of mind. This priest of Isis practices a large eclecticism.
He goes to Delphi and divides his time between the
service of the temple and theological discussion. He worships
especially one god, Apollo of Delphi, Helios of
Emesa. Apollo directs the drama of his story, Helios
crowns it in Ethiopia. One sees in Heliodorus the intention
of simplifying and unifying mythology and of
bringing back religion to its eastern and Egyptian origins.
Instead of wishing to discredit pagan stories, he treats them
philosophically to make them acceptable to an age which
was becoming emancipated and more severe and to a new
faith which wished to reconcile the philosophical tradition
and the sense of the divine and the mysterious.</p>
<p>Neo-Pythagoreanism was a curious attempt to found a
religion which would satisfy both the critical spirit and
the people. At the beginning of the third century appeared
<i>The Life of Apollonius of Tyana</i>, a magician and
a disciple of Pythagoras. Philostratus takes his hero to
the Orient, Ethiopia, Greece, Rome. He writes a real
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
romance. And that of Heliodorus recalls it often. Both
authors show the same admiration for the Gymnosophists,
the same distinction between magic and theurgy. Both
Apollonius and Calasiris are opposed to impure sacrifices.
The story of the magical Pantarb&egrave; jewel appears in both
Philostratus and Heliodorus. Calasiris like Apollonius
is a model of Pythagorean asceticism. Apollonius defends
himself about working miracles and lets a doubt appear
about his theurgic powers. Calasiris shows in daily life
a common wisdom and reserves for exceptional cases an
appeal to great demons.</p>
<p>In the <i>Aethiopica</i> dreams play a more important role
than the demons. Communications with the invisible
world are constant, but only exceptional human beings
who have had long experience in divine matters and a life
mortified and purified by expiation know the mysteries
of the invisible world.</p>
<p>This paraphrase of Maillon&rsquo;s paragraphs shows how
completely logical is the conclusion of the romance where
the noble Gymnosophist Sisimithres persuades the king
of the Ethiopians and his people to renounce human sacrifice
and accept the divine blessing on the loves of Theagenes
and Chariclea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At length Hydaspes said to Sisimithres, &lsquo;O sage! What are we
to do? To defraud the gods of their victims is not pious; to sacrifice
those who appear to be preserved and restored by their providence
is impious. It needs that some expedient be found out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sisimithres, speaking, not in the Grecian, but in the Ethiopian
tongue, so as to be heard by the greatest part of the assembly, replied:
&lsquo;O king! The wisest among men, as it appears, often have
the understanding clouded through excess of joy, else, before this
time, you would have discovered that the gods regard not with favour
the sacrifice which you have been preparing for them. First
they, from the very altar, declared the all-blessed Chariclea to be
your daughter; next they brought her foster-father most wonderfully
from the midst of Greece to this spot; they struck panic and
terror into the horses and oxen which were being prepared for sacrifice,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
indicating, perhaps, by that event, that those whom custom
considered as the more perfect and fitting victims were to be rejected.
Now, as the consummation of all good, as the perfection
of the piece, they show this Grecian youth to be the betrothed husband
of the maiden. Let us give credence to these proofs of the
divine and wonder-working will; let us be fellow workers with this
will; let us have recourse to holier offerings; let us abolish, for
ever, these detested human sacrifices.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few words must be said on the style of Heliodorus.
It is predominantly literary, but extremely varied. He
uses Homer almost as much as Chariton does. His adaptation
of Homeric episodes has already been described.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a>
A discussion of Homer and his parentage between Calasiris
and Cnemon is introduced in the style of the rhetorical
schools.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a> Descriptions as well as episodes owe much to
Homeric coloring, witness the epiphany of Odysseus.<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a>
But above all the language itself is almost as rich in quotations
from Homer as is Chariton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Often reminiscent phraseology betrays quotations in
solution. Frequently too very famous phrases are quoted
directly. Calasiris greets Nausicles with that best of all
wishes: &ldquo;May the gods give you your heart&rsquo;s desire!&rdquo;
Nausicles reminds Calasiris that the gifts of the gods are
not to be despised. The maid Cybele assures Arsace that
soon Theagenes will desert Chariclea for her, exchanging
bronze for gold.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a> Emotional crises are described or expressed
in Homer&rsquo;s words. Arsace&rsquo;s sleeplessness has the
same manifestations as Achilles. Cnemon upbraids Chariclea
for her pessimism about Theagenes&rsquo; fate in the words
of Agamemnon to Chalchas. And Chariclea when she
is questioned by physicians as to the cause of her illness
only keeps repeating: &ldquo;Achilles, Peleus&rsquo; son, noblest of
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Greeks!&rdquo; as though only the apostrophe uttered by Patroclus
could describe her dear Theagenes.<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a> These are but
a few illustrations of Heliodorus&rsquo; constant use of Homeric
diction.</p>
<p>No less did he use the language of the theater.<a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a> We
have already seen how much his plot owes to the structure
of Greek tragedy. From drama he took also a vocabulary
of pungent metaphors to describe the progress of events
in his story. Repeatedly the action is referred to as a
tragedy.<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> And certain scenes by their wording imply a
recognition, a <i>deus ex machina</i>, a prologue and a change
from tragedy to comedy. These may, as Calderini suggests,
be reminiscences of contemporary plays now lost,
which readers of the time would recognize.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a> Certainly
structure and language of the romance attest Heliodorus&rsquo;
deep interest in the theater.</p>
<p>The third striking element in the diction of Heliodorus
is the rhetorical. He often uses all the artifices taught
in the schools: alliterations, antitheses, set phrases. He
loves the grand style. A speech, even one uttered by his
charming heroine, is an opportunity for pomposity. He
uses in excess that fine writing for descriptive passages
which the schools taught and he scatters throughout his
narrative pithy truisms or <i>sententiae</i> which were part of
the capital of the rhetorician.</p>
<p>But these lapses into over-refined phrases, laborious
symmetry and decorative rhetoric are less of a barrier to
a modern reader than is his syntax. His sentence structure
in general is not paratactic as is so much of Chariton
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
and of Xenophon, but complex. Moreover these complex
sentences are often exceedingly long with a kind of agglutinative
accumulation of participial constructions that
demands re-reading for comprehension. Yet he can be
simple and pellucid in rapid narrative and emotional crises
as the final Book shows. And it is just because much of
his narrative is so exciting that we fall into resentful criticism
when Homer nods in dull drowsiness.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
<p>Although we cannot date the <i>Aethiopica</i> more exactly
than somewhere in the third century (probably in the
first half), the romance reflects in general the life of the
times in which Heliodorus lived. The east daubs its brilliant
colors upon the story as the power of oriental rulers
impinges on the life of the Greeks. The absolutism of
the Great King of Persia is the model for minor courts of
viceroys and their queens who demand of their subjects
and captives the obeisance that they must render to their
Super-Ruler. Military officers and eunuchs are the descending
steps in this hierarchy of tyranny.</p>
<p>Adventures center in war and travel. Cities and tribes
revolt. Heroes must display military virtues. Merchants,
priests and women travel widely, braving the dangers of
storms at sea and of attacks by pirates. Women have
found a new freedom and are leaders in courage and endurance
as the story of Chariclea shows. Women take
part in banquets and religious ceremonies as well as in
adventures. Romantic friendship between men and admiration
of young men&rsquo;s beauty are a counterpart of the
famous relation between Hadrian and Antinous. Slaves
and captives may become court favorites or be subjected
to indignities, imprisonment, torture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The times are characterized too by an eager search for
the new, the unfamiliar, by scientific curiosity, by an interest
in art. So descriptions of strange countries and
peoples, accounts of strange adventures and sights are part
of the novelist&rsquo;s stock in trade. He describes vividly the
island city in the Nile&rsquo;s delta, its water-ways through the
reeds, its cave refuge with its secret entrance; or he gives
a technical account of the engineering processes by which
a city is besieged by threat of inundation; or he pictures
such a curiosity in the animal world as a giraffe. Works
of art are featured with admiring care: Theagenes&rsquo; embroidered
robe and its clasp, Chariclea&rsquo;s robe and its girdle,
the amethyst ring with its carved scene, the painting of
Perseus and Andromeda, nude, shining, chained to the
rock.</p>
<p>And part of the picture of the times centers in man&rsquo;s
quest for new values for life itself. Ethical standards for
conduct are weighed and emphasized in contrasts between
Greeks and barbarians. Aspiration towards the higher
life is portrayed in the worship of the gods and its ceremonials
and in the philosophical discussions in which the
priests take part. The Gymnosophists and Calasiris share
a large humanity.</p>
<p>The primary interests of the romance, however, far outweighing
its philosophy and its adventures, is love. Once
more two enchanting young people meet at a festival of
a god, fall in love at first sight, plight their troth, accompany
each other through world-wide adventures, preserve
their faith and their chastity and for their piety are at last
united in perfect happiness. Theagenes and Chariclea
join Chaereas and Callirhoe, Habrocomes and Anthia,
Clitophon and Leucippe, Daphnis and Chloe in the undying
annals of true love. And the reader closes Heliodorus&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
novel with Cnemon&rsquo;s comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am at feud with Homer, father, for saying that love, as well
as everything else, brings satiety in the end; for my part I am
never tired either of feeling it myself, or hearing of its influence on
others; and lives there the man of so iron and adamantine an
heart, as not to be enchanted with listening to the loves of Theagenes
and Chariclea, though the story were to last a year?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c5">V
<br />THE ADVENTURES OF LEUCIPPE AND CLITOPHON
<br /><i>BY ACHILLES TATIUS</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Every romance,&rdquo; says Aristide Calderini in writing of
the Greek novels, &ldquo;represents successively a new advance
or a new type in its genre. Now the closest affiliation is
with history, now with pastoral poetry, now with philosophy.
While certain common elements persist, the general
pattern of the whole changes; often the content is
varied; often the limits.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
<p>The variation within this new form of literature is richly
illustrated by the novel we are now to study, the one which
was probably written last of the extant Greek Romances
as Chariton&rsquo;s was the first. This is <i>The Adventures of
Leucippe and Clitophon</i> of Achilles Tatius.</p>
<p>We know little of the author. Suidas, the lexicographer
of the tenth century, wrote his brief biography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Achilles Statius&rdquo; (note the incorrect form of the name &lsquo;Tatius&rsquo;)
&ldquo;of Alexandria: the writer of the story of Leucippe and Clitophon,
as well as other episodes of love, in eight books. He finally became
a Christian and a bishop. He also wrote a treatise on the sphere,
and works on etymology, and a mixed narration telling of many
great and marvellous men. His novel is in all respects like that
of the other writers of love-romances.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Now though Suidas used earlier material and essayed
accuracy, two statements in this biography are manifestly
incorrect. There is nothing whatever in the romance to
indicate that Tatius was ever a Christian and the story
about his conversion and bishopric probably duplicates
the similar tradition about his predecessor, Heliodorus,
who was identified with a bishop of Tricca who bore his
name. Moreover Tatius&rsquo; novel is very different in many
particulars from all the romances which are now known.
And it is these contrasts rather than the similarities which
make him in our studies so excellent a foil for Chariton.</p>
<p>The date of about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 300 is probably right for the
novel because the author seems to imitate the style of certain
romancers of the third century and because a recently
discovered papyrus fragment<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a> shows that for palaeographical
reasons this earliest manuscript could not have been
written later than the first half of the fourth century. This
evidence about the lateness of Achilles Tatius we shall
find borne out by a deterioration in style from Chariton&rsquo;s
simplicity to an over-elaboration and exaggeration and a
change in spirit from sincerity to ironic parody.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
<p>One important reason for knowing Achilles Tatius
is &ldquo;his contributions to Elizabethan prose fiction and,
through this, to the making of the modern novel.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a> The
first Greek text was not published until 1601 but before
this he was made known to the sixteenth century by translations
in Latin, Italian and French. And in 1597 the first
English translation, that of William Burton, appeared.
Todd succinctly states his resulting influence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With Heliodorus, though in less measure, he furnished structure
and material for Sidney&rsquo;s Arcadia, and thus was among the
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
influences that formed the novels of Richardson and Walter Scott;
of Greene, as Dr. S. L. Wolff puts it, he was the &lsquo;first and latest
love&rsquo;; in Lyly himself, and not only in him, we recognize Tatius
as one of the sources of English Euphuism.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My plan in taking up Achilles Tatius is first to analyze
briefly his plot and then summarize its similarities to <i>Chaereas
and Callirhoe</i> and the other Greek novels. Then I
shall discuss more in detail the unique features in Tatius
and his special characteristics.</p>
<p>An epigram in the Palatine Anthology, attributed to
Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, but by some to Leon
the philosopher gives a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the story.<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The story of Clitophon reveals to the eyes, as it were, a bitter
love but a virtuous life. The very virtuous life of Leucippe puts
all in ecstasy, (for the story tells) how she was beaten and shorn of
her hair and clothed pitiably, and&mdash;the greatest point&mdash;having
died three times she endured to the end. And if you too wish to be
virtuous, friend, do not consider the side issues of the plot, but
learn first the outcome of the story, for it joins in marriage those
who love sanely.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the expansion of this epitome it is necessary to have
before us a list of the many characters in the romance.</p>
<p>Chief characters:</p>

<p>For the plot I condense Phillimore&rsquo;s well-written summary.<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a>
The author begins with a description of Sidon.
He has reached Sidon in his travels and is touring the city,
looking at the temples. He describes a painting of Zeus
and Europa, also a statue of Eros. He was reflecting on
the Eros: &ldquo;Think of such a brat being lord of earth and
sea!&rdquo; When a young man near testifies to Eros&rsquo; power
which he has felt, the author invites him to tell his story.
In a Platonic scene under a plane-tree near a stream they
sit down.</p>
<p>The stranger, Clitophon, a Greek of Tyre, tells his story
in the first person. Clitophon has been unwillingly betrothed
at nineteen to his half-sister, Calligone. Now his
uncle, Sostratus, writes that he is sending his daughter
Leucippe and her mother from their home in Byzantium
to Tyre for safety during a war. Clitophon at once falls
in love with Leucippe. He makes his cousin, Clinias,
his confidant. Clinias is sympathetic because he had a
tragic love affair with a youth who was killed by a fall
from a horse which Clinias gave him. (Here is introduced
a purple patch on the driving accident.)</p>
<p>Encouraged by Clinias, Clitophon makes love constantly.
Various scenes of his wooing, for example a
garden, are described in detail. Finally the lovers elope,
find a ship at Berytus, embark and start to Alexandria.
They meet an Egyptian fellow-passenger, Menelaus.
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
There comes a great storm. Hero and heroine are cast
on shore at Pelusium near the temple of Zeus Casius.
Enter black brigands. Soldiers rescue Clitophon, but
Leucippe is kidnapped. Clitophon joins in an attempt
to save her, but it is baulked by a deep, impassable canal
between the rescuing party and the ten thousand brigands.
Across it Clitophon watches the bandits perform
a human sacrifice by disembowelling the victim before
an altar. It is Leucippe. The body is put in a coffin.</p>
<p>The next day the canal is diked and crossed. Clitophon
resolves to die on Leucippe&rsquo;s body, but suddenly he meets
his slave Satyrus and Menelaus, both saved from the wreck,
who assure him that Leucippe is alive. On the coffin
being opened, she comes out&mdash;&ldquo;Gashed open and minus
all viscera.&rdquo; But the murderers had been deceived by a
sheepskin full of animal entrails attached to her and by
a stage sword which never penetrated her body. Clinias
too was saved from the wreck. Now a punitive expedition
under Charmides, the Egyptian, starts, but unfortunately
he falls in love with Leucippe and has a philtre
given her which drives her insane. On her recovery they
go to Alexandria. There a new rival, Chaereas, abducts
Leucippe. Clitophon pursues on a ship of war, but has
to endure seeing Leucippe beheaded on the deck of the
enemy&rsquo;s vessel. Clitophon recovers the head from the
sea and gives it burial.</p>
<p>Six months later Clitophon meets Clinias again. Clinias
who had been home in Sidon reports that &ldquo;the cruel parent
had actually betrothed the loving cousins&rdquo; so Clitophon
and Leucippe might have married in peace. Clitophon
who naturally believes Leucippe dead is pursued by Melitte,
a lovely, wealthy and amorous widow of Ephesus.
He finally yields to her; they are betrothed in the temple
of Isis and are to be married when they reach Ephesus.
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
On their arrival, Melitte drives Clitophon around her
great estates. There he has the overwhelming surprise
of encountering Leucippe who is working in the garden
as a miserable slave. This difficult situation is made more
complicated by the sudden reappearance of Melitte&rsquo;s husband,
Thersander, who had been falsely reported drowned
at sea. Thersander beats up Clitophon as an adulterer
with his wife and has him imprisoned.</p>
<p>Sosthenes, the bailiff of Thersander, interests his master
in Leucippe, so he tries to seduce her, but unsuccessfully.
Clitophon in prison is told a false story that both Leucippe
and Melitte are faithless to him. Clitophon resolves to
denounce Melitte as an accomplice in a plot for the murder
of Leucippe and then to die. He is tried for adultery
and self-confessed murder, but Clinias foils his attempt by
telling the whole truth in court. Sosthenes departs, leaving
Leucippe free. Leucippe&rsquo;s father, Sostratus, by good
fortune arrives in Ephesus on a sacred embassy just in
time to assist his daughter. The trial of Clitophon is
resumed in a long court scene in which finally Thersander
challenges Leucippe and Melitte to tests of chastity by
the magic pipes of Pan and the magic spring of Rhodopis.
Both pass the ordeals. Thersander, since everything is
going against him, for his slave, Sosthenes, has been captured
and will be forced to confess the truth, flees. Sosthenes
confesses. Clitophon is acquitted. Leucippe tells
her whole story: how the bandits beheaded another
woman dressed in her clothes to prevent Clitophon from
following; how a quarrel over her arose among them in
which Chaereas was slain; then she was sold by the other
pirates to Sosthenes, who bought her for Thersander.
Sostratus then relates the secondary romance of Callisthenes
and Calligone. The novel ends with a happy reunion
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
of all at Tyre where prayers and sacrifices are offered
in behalf of the lasting felicity of Clitophon and Leucippe,
of Callisthenes and Calligone.</p>
<p>Such is the story which Phillimore characterizes as &ldquo;a
breathless succession of improbable incident.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a> The settings
move with the same cinematic rapidity which Chariton
employed: from Sidon to Berytus, to the sea and
shipwreck, to Pelusium and Alexandria, to Ephesus and
the great court scene, to Byzantium and back again to
Tyre.</p>
<p>In one point particularly the structure of the plot differs
from Chariton&rsquo;s and indeed from the plots of all the other
Greek Romances. The author in the beginning hands
over the story to a narrator, the hero, Clitophon, who then
tells the events in the first person. Very soon, however,
the reader has forgotten this device: so many other characters
are given the floor to relate their own tales. And at
the end the author too has forgotten this beginning, for
Clitophon does not round up his narrative with a polite
farewell. He does not even explain how he happened to
be at Sidon where he started the tale. And the author
does not express his appreciation of the entertainment
Clitophon has given him.<a class="fn" id="fr_144" href="#fn_144">[144]</a></p>
<p>The chief interests of the romance are again love, adventure
and religion. There are two love-stories of primary
interest instead of one. Yet the bulk of the plot turns
on adventure rather than on sex or worship. And delight
in adventure adds to the typical travellers&rsquo; tales a flaming
curiosity which demands description of many strange novelties.</p>
<p>In general the technical devices common to all the romances
are used. There is much conversation. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
are many soliloquies. Clitophon upbraids himself for
swerving from Calligone to Leucippe.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a> Later he bemoans
Leucippe&rsquo;s fate when she has been kidnapped by
the blacks.<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> Leucippe, sold as a slave, laments her whole
sad love-story while lustful Thersander is eavesdropping
outside the door.<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> Clitophon, on hearing in prison the
false story that Leucippe has been murdered by Melitte,
voices his horror over her death and over the fact that he
had kissed her slayer.<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> These soliloquies are employed
to reveal the intense feelings of hero and heroine at emotional
crises.</p>
<p>Three letters are used. The first is a brief business
letter which serves to develop the plot, for in it Sostratus
writes to his brother Hippias that he is sending his daughter
Leucippe and his wife Panthea to him for safe-keeping
until the war between the Byzantines and the Thracians
is over.<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a> The other two are love-letters. One is Leucippe&rsquo;s
to Clitophon telling him that she has been sold as
a slave, begging for ransom money, wishing him happiness
in his coming nuptials with Melitte, and assuring him she
is still a virgin. The other is Clitophon&rsquo;s answer declaring
that he has &ldquo;imitated her virginity, if there be any
virginity in men,&rdquo; begging her not to judge him until he
can explain all, but to pity him.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a> Leucippe&rsquo;s letter is
found by Melitte and helps motivate the plot in its emotional
aspects, for it works Melitte up through jealousy
and despair to such passionate ardor that she persuades
Clitophon to sleep one night with her.<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a></p>
<p>Oaths are not important in the structure of the plot.
Once Leucippe swears to her father by Artemis that she
has told him a true story about being still a maid.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
Dreams are frequent and are significant. Four are reported
which are vital factors in the plot. Clitophon&rsquo;s
father dreams that while he is conducting the wedding
ceremonies of his son and Calligone the torches are extinguished.
This dream leads him to hasten the marriage
so distasteful to Clitophon and it would have been consummated
at once had not Calligone been kidnapped by
Callisthenes under the impression that she was Leucippe.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a>
Then Clitophon had persuaded Leucippe to let him spend
the night with her and with the aid of Satyrus was already
in her bedroom. Leucippe&rsquo;s mother who had just had
a dream that a robber with a naked sword was playing the
part of Jack the Ripper with her daughter, rushed in and
interrupted the amour.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a> Later on, Leucippe and Clitophon
on the same night have similar dreams. A goddess
appears and warns each that their love must not be consummated
until the goddess decks the bride and opens
her temple to the bridegroom. This apparition makes
them postpone the rites of Aphrodite.<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> In Book VII
Sostratus, Leucippe&rsquo;s father, sees in a dream an apparition
of Artemis who tells him that he will find Leucippe and
Clitophon in Ephesus. He goes to Ephesus then on a
sacred embassy and finds that Artemis does not lie.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a></p>
<p>This tendency to a repeated use of the same device for
forwarding the plot is seen in greater extravagance and
exaggeration in the use of apparent deaths. Leucippe is
supposed to meet violent death three times, twice before
the eyes of her lover, once in vivid narrative told to him
in prison. First she is sacrificed by brigands by being
disembowelled before an altar. Second she is beheaded
on the deck of a ship by black pirates and her head tossed
into the ocean. Third she is murdered by an assassin
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
hired by Melitte.<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a> In the first two cases ghastly details
make the executions seem real, but Leucippe always survives
and reappears with a plausible but exotic story.
Surely in this exaggeration Achilles Tatius is using thinly
veiled satire of the device of improbable reappearances in
the Greek romance.</p>
<p>The same exuberance appears in the use of the forensic
speeches, of long, mythological narratives and of wordy
descriptions. All these will be considered in the study
of the style of the romance. Two more technical devices
of the plot must be mentioned here: the use of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s
and the usual happy ending. Book VIII is crowded with
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s: Clitophon tells all his adventures to Sostratus
and the priest of Artemis. Leucippe relates to Sostratus
how the pirates decapitated another woman in her place.
Finally Sostratus relates to his daughter and to Clitophon
the romance of Callisthenes and Calligone.<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a> The romances
of both pairs of lovers, Clitophon and Leucippe,
Callisthenes and Calligone, are concluded by happy weddings.
And among the leading characters only Melitte
suffers final disappointment. Achilles Tatius ironically
grants her at least one memorable embrace on a prison
floor!</p>
<p>The character drawing is much less elaborate than the
plot. While plot and counterplot of the two romances
interplay, the young hero Clitophon and the beautiful
Leucippe are more or less conventional figures who
move glamorously, weeping, fainting, dreaming, voyaging,
through preposterous adventures. But Callisthenes,
the secondary hero, is far more interesting than Clitophon
because his character shows startling development. And
Melitte, though she plays the part of temptress, is a great
human creation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>In Book II Callisthenes first appears as a wealthy orphan,
who is notoriously dissipated and extravagant. Wishing
to marry beauty and having a strange streak of romanticism
he asked Sostratus for the hand of the beautiful Leucippe
although he had never seen her. Rejected by Sostratus
as a suitor because of his bad reputation he plotted vengeance
in his willful and violent way. He journeyed to
Tyre, saw Calligone at a festival, mistook her for Leucippe,
fell in love at first sight, hired some gangsters to kidnap
her and sailed off with his prize.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a> Callisthenes does not
reappear until in the end of Book VIII Sostratus tells the
story of his reform.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a> On the voyage Callisthenes found
himself madly in love with Calligone, revealed to her that
he was no pirate but a wealthy Byzantine noble, offered
her honorable marriage and a large dowry, and promised
to respect her chastity as long as she desired. At Byzantium,
love transformed him so that he appeared courteous,
virtuous, self-controlled. He showed great respect for his
elders. He was no longer extravagant, but became philanthropic.
He gave large contributions to the state. He
trained for military service and won distinction in actual
warfare. In this changed guise he secured Sostratus as
an advocate to persuade Hippias to give him the hand
of Calligone, whose chastity he had scrupulously respected.
Eros thus salvaged Callisthenes and then rewarded him.</p>
<p>Melitte the widow of Ephesus is the most elaborately
drawn character in the romance. There is even a long
personal description of her: she is as beautiful as a statue
with skin like milk, cheeks roses, hair thick, long, golden,
and about her the radiance of Aphrodite. Clitophon admits
he saw her with pleasure. Indeed she is so magnetic
that the kisses she was pleased to bestow on him stirred
him.<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> She knew what she wanted and how to get it.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
During four months she had to woo Clitophon though
she was rich and young and her husband has been lost at
sea. Finally since Clitophon was convinced that Leucippe
was really dead, he yielded and agreed to marry her,
though on condition that they should not be united until
they arrived at Ephesus. She was as passionate as Clitophon
was cold. On the ship she made ardent love to him
while he begged her to philosophize on love&rsquo;s nature.
After Clitophon secretly received Leucippe&rsquo;s letter, he
had to pretend illness to postpone the fulfillment of her
desires. Then Melitte sent for her so-called Thessalian
slave Lacaena (really Leucippe) and begged her to concoct
a philtre that would arouse Clitophon&rsquo;s feeling. She is
very outspoken about the fact that Clitophon seems made
of iron or wood; that indeed she seemed to love a statue.<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a>
And she had the ability to express to Clitophon every feeling
she had without inhibition and in most picturesque
language. At her wedding breakfast in Alexandria she
punned merrily about the postponement of their union.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of a cenotaph but never before of a cenogam.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a>
The bellying sail on the ship she compared to
a pregnant woman&rsquo;s body; indeed she converted the whole
ship into symbols of marriage.<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a> She also compared herself
to thirsty Tantalus standing by a river but not allowed
to drink. She could match Clitophon&rsquo;s arguments and
his quibbles did not deceive her: &ldquo;You are playing the
sophist, dearest!&rdquo; she commented. When from the discovery
of Leucippe&rsquo;s letter to Clitophon and her husband&rsquo;s
safe return she knew that she had lost Clitophon, she visited
him secretly in prison and poured out on him all her wrath
and all her passion. Her denunciation of him as eunuch,
hermaphrodite, senile nonentity shifted to adoration;
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
and passion finally concentrated into so ardent and well
argued an appeal for one embrace that she was victorious.
Clitophon admitted ironically that love had taught her
rhetoric and that he was vanquished, so he gave the remedy
to a sick soul and even on the prison floor enjoyed
her!<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a></p>
<p>Melitte was no less subtle and plausible in the speech in
which she made her peace with her enraged husband Thersander:
Clitophon was only one of many refugees whom
she aided in memory of her husband lost at sea; indeed
she had helped Clitophon to find his wife.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a> When Thersander
challenged her by the ordeal of the water of the
Styx, Melitte at once accepted the test on a quibble because
her husband had demanded from her an oath that
she had not fulfilled the rites of Aphrodite with the
stranger <i>during the time while he himself was abroad</i>.
And it was just that unfortunate stipulation which makes
her last appearance in the romance unforgettable. She
is led out of the water of the Styx by the judge, proved by
indisputable ordeal a chaste woman! Achilles Tatius
has won his readers by this time to rejoice in Melitte&rsquo;s
vindication. For besides charm and cleverness he has
given her humanity and generosity. She was always merciful
to her slaves and was kindness itself to Lacaena-Leucippe.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a>
After she had won her desire, she contrived
the escape of Clitophon from prison dressed in her clothes,
and financed by her. She did not even forget the jailer,
but gave him money to go away for a time to avoid punishment.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a>
Clitophon omitted in his final narrative of his
adventures his succumbing to Melitte<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a> but he had the
grace to admit to himself her charms.</p>
<p>It is clear that in the ethics of the romance there is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
new point of view. Achilles Tatius is definitely less idealistic
than Chariton in his treatment of the erotic theme.
As Rattenbury has pointed out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Achilles Tatius seems to have felt that the fetish of
chastity in the average romance was absurd, and tries to
humanize romance by creating characters that are reasonably,
not unreasonably, moral.... Leucippe comes
through safe and sound, it is true, but it was by good luck
rather than by good intention.&rdquo; Clitophon is chaste as far
as men can be and succumbs to Melitte only once. &ldquo;Achilles
Tatius,&rdquo; continues Rattenbury, &ldquo;did not exactly parody
his predecessors, but it is suggested that by attempting to
humanize romance he not only showed up the absurdities
of the usual stories, but was also responsible for the overthrow
of the literary form.... Achilles Tatius seems to
have been to Greek Romance what Euripides was to Greek
Tragedy. He broke down the conventions, and drove the
essential and permanent elements to seek refuge elsewhere.
The erotic element did not die, but found an outlet in
&lsquo;Love-Letters,&rsquo; a contemporary literary form of which
Aristaenetus was an exponent in the fifth century, but
the idealized love story of a superhumanly modest hero
and heroine vanished, and Greek Romance hibernated
until it was revived some centuries later by the Byzantine
writers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_170" href="#fn_170">[170]</a></p>
<p>Not inconsistent with Tatius&rsquo; slightly ironic treatment
of amours is his emphasis on the virtue of pity and his
tendency to introduce long philosophical discussions of
conduct or the nature of love. Clitophon&rsquo;s story moves
an Egyptian general to pity, tears and aid, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When a man hears of another&rsquo;s misfortune, he is inclined
towards pity, and pity is often the introduction to friendship; the
heart is softened by grief for what it hears, and gradually feeling
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
the same emotions at the mournful story converts its commiseration
into friendship and the grief into pity.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the midst of Thersander&rsquo;s attempt to rape the weeping
Leucippe, there is a long digression on tears and the
pity they arouse.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> Clinias appeals to the court not to
put to death &ldquo;a man who deserves pity rather than punishment.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a>
Leucippe, disguised as a slave, begs Melitte
as a woman to pity a woman and to pity one once free,
now through Fortune&rsquo;s will a slave.<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a></p>
<p>Tatius has presented also in Callisthenes a picture of a
noble young hero who was converted from the wildness of
youth to self-control, respect, patriotism and service by
chivalrous love.<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a> And this portrait of Callisthenes becomes
an embodiment of an ideal latent in the philosophical
discussions of love which flavor the romance. &ldquo;Love,&rdquo;
says Clitophon, &ldquo;inspired by beauty enters the heart
through the eyes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a> Later Clinias tells Clitophon that
he is greatly fortunate in being able to see his lady, for
when eyes of lovers meet, the emanations of their beauty
wed in a spiritual union that transcends bodily embrace.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a>
Clitophon, wooing Leucippe in a fair garden, discourses
to her on the power of love over birds, creeping things,
plants, even iron which responds to the magnet, over
water (for Arethusa and Alpheus wed).<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a> To cheer up
Menelaus and Clinias on ship-board and divert them from
their sorrows, Clitophon starts a philosophic discussion on
love of women compared with love of men, untranslatable
in its openness.<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> Menelaus takes up the cudgels for the
love of men, probably much to Clinias&rsquo; satisfaction for he
had previously denounced to his dear Charicles the love of
women who, if they love, kill and had arraigned for his
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
indictment Eriphyle, Philomela, Sthenoboea, Chryseis,
Briseis, Candaules&rsquo; wife, Helen, Penelope, Phaedra, Clytemnestra!<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a></p>
<p>The worship of the kiss is featured in an enchanting
story of a magic charm breathed on the lover&rsquo;s lips<a class="fn" id="fr_181" href="#fn_181">[181]</a> and
a fantastic assertion that if a maiden&rsquo;s kiss is stolen, the
maid is raped.<a class="fn" id="fr_182" href="#fn_182">[182]</a> Moreover a code of love is presented,
almost as detailed as Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Ars Amatoria</i>, in instructions
given by Clinias to Clitophon,<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a> by the slave Satyrus to
Clitophon,<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a> by Clitophon in discussion with Menelaus.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a>
A delightful part of this Art of Love is telling the Lady
love-stories, for all womankind is fond of myths.<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a> Magic
too plays its part in the technique of love, for incantation
works a charm for a lover;<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a> philtres may bewitch the
indifferent;<a class="fn" id="fr_188" href="#fn_188">[188]</a> and ordeals test chastity.<a class="fn" id="fr_189" href="#fn_189">[189]</a></p>
<p>Closely akin to the philosophical discussions of love, its
power, its art, its magic is the worship of Aphrodite, the
mother of Eros. Yet there are few references to her cult.
Her dominance is hinted: initiation into love makes
Aphrodite the most powerful of gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a> Melitte wishes
to have her nuptials on the sea, for Aphrodite is the sea&rsquo;s
daughter and she wishes to propitiate her as the goddess of
marriage by thus honoring the sea, her mother.<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> Clitophon
at the end of his separation from Leucippe prays to
Lady Aphrodite to forgive the long delay in their union,
for it was due to no insult to her and he begs her blessing
on their marriage.<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a> The story of the ordeal by the water
of the Styx<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a> is a merry tale of rivalry between Artemis
and Aphrodite for a young girl&rsquo;s worship in which Aphrodite
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
made young Rhodopis break her oath of chastity but
Artemis changed her into a spring in the very cave where
she lost her virginity. Yet Achilles Tatius presents no
such deep-seated reverence for the goddess of Love as that
which permeates Chariton&rsquo;s romance.</p>
<p>Artemis of Ephesus is rather the deity who dominates
Tatius&rsquo; story. She appears in dreams to the heroine and
to Leucippe&rsquo;s father.<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> In her name Leucippe rebukes
Thersander for insulting a virgin in the city of the Virgin
Goddess.<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a> Sostratus arrives at Ephesus as the head of a
sacred embassy in honor of Artemis and so finds his daughter.<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a>
Leucippe has taken refuge in the temple of Artemis
and in that temple at last she and Clitophon are reunited.<a class="fn" id="fr_197" href="#fn_197">[197]</a>
Here the villain of the piece Thersander brutally attacks
Clitophon.<a class="fn" id="fr_198" href="#fn_198">[198]</a> Thersander&rsquo;s lawyer in court makes insulting
slanders about the fact that Clitophon and Leucippe
probably defiled the temple by an amour there.<a class="fn" id="fr_199" href="#fn_199">[199]</a> But
Artemis is proved to be no liar, and there is implicit recognition
of her protection of Leucippe though Achilles
Tatius does not end with thanksgiving to her. Her cult
forms an objective background of religious tradition for
the action. No deep religious feeling for her is manifested.</p>
<p>There is no more aspiration to god in the other cults
which are mentioned incidentally: of Apollo, Hercules
of Tyre, the god of the lower world, Pan. And the cruel
goddess Fortune is berated only occasionally. Superstition
recognizes omens in the world of nature: the eagle
stealing the sacrifice, the hawk pursuing the swallow.<a class="fn" id="fr_200" href="#fn_200">[200]</a>
Oracles are respected.<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a> And the ordeals of Pan&rsquo;s pipes
and the Styx&rsquo;s water receive general credence. Festivals
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
to the gods are celebrated.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a> But religion seems rather a
matter of scrupulous regard for ritual than communion
with god or relief to the soul.</p>
<p>As we compare the romances of Chariton and Achilles
Tatius we find that not only has the main interest shifted
from love and worship to incidents and adventures. An
even greater change has come about in the style. Homeric
simplicity has given way to rhetorical elaboration.
Tatius may well have been a <span title="rh&ecirc;t&ocirc;r" class="g">&#8165;&#8053;&tau;&omega;&rho;</span> as the scholiast Thomas
Magister states, for his whole style is dyed in the rhetoric
of the schools and the speeches delivered in the various
lawsuits in the plot are masterpieces of rhetoric.</p>
<p>Among his acknowledged literary debts, however, he
credits most to epic, for he quotes Homer once<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a> and alludes
to him five times<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> and he refers to Hesiod twice.<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a>
The messenger speeches in tragedy undoubtedly suggested
the slave&rsquo;s dramatic narrative of the death of Charicles in
a riding accident.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a> Both the New and the Old Attic
Comedy contributed much to his humor: the New in the
comic literary contest of the slaves Conops and Satyrus
who deride each other under cover of fables;<a class="fn" id="fr_207" href="#fn_207">[207]</a> and the
Old in the Aristophanic priest of Artemis who &ldquo;was no
poor hand at speaking, and as good at quip and gibe as
the plays of Aristophanes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_208" href="#fn_208">[208]</a> But the training of the
rhetorical schools outweighs all other influences. About
half of Books VII and VIII is devoted to the trial of Clitophon
for adultery and self-confessed murder. The court
sits in Ephesus with a jury and a presiding judge, but their
functions are vague. The prosecution speaks first, Thersander
and his ten lawyers, whose speeches fortunately are
not reported. Clitophon answers them by a false narrative
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
accusing himself of the murder of Leucippe and involving
Melitte. Clinias gets the floor and tells the true
story: that Clitophon desires only to die, that he deserves
pity rather than condemnation and must be regarded as
insane.</p>
<p>In the wild confusion that follows, Thersander&rsquo;s counsel
shouts for a sentence of murder, Melitte offers her slaves
to be questioned on her innocence and demands that her
husband produce Sosthenes who is probably the murderer.
Thersander in a long speech answers Melitte&rsquo;s challenge
about Sosthenes with the result that the presiding officer
pronounces sentence of death on Clitophon but postpones
Melitte&rsquo;s case. Clitophon is just on the point of being
tortured for evidence when the arrival of a sacred embassy
to Artemis postpones the case of Melitte and the execution
of Clitophon.</p>
<p>Only after the work of the embassy is finished is the case
resumed. Then Thersander speaks first, demanding the
execution of the sentence. He condemns the priest who
has released Clitophon and says he has usurped the function
of giving refuge to criminals which belongs to Artemis.
He adds foul personal abuse. He presents a second
charge against Melitte for adultery and a third against
his slave girl Leucippe and her father. The priest in his
reply deserves the epithet &ldquo;Aristophanic&rdquo; which he has
won, for he pays Thersander back in his own coin of abuse
only clothing it in the wit of Aristophanes with all his
double-meaning of words, his biting attack. And his own
arguments point the irony of the situation: Thersander
clapped Clitophon in jail before he was allowed to defend
himself. He charged him with murdering Leucippe but
the young lady is alive!</p>
<p>Sopater, counsel for Thersander, next hurls insulting
invective at the priest and whitewashes his noble client
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
who has been betrayed by a faithless wife. Thersander
then presents a formal challenge to Melitte and Leucippe
to prove their chastity and on their acceptance of it, the
court adjourns. Next day all reassemble at the cave of
Pan and the spring of the Styx. The ladies are proved
innocent. Thersander flees and then is sentenced to banishment.
Clitophon&mdash;and Melitte&mdash;are acquitted.</p>
<p>This summary of the procedure of the court in Ephesus
shows what opportunity Achilles Tatius made for presenting
the rhetorical speeches which he cherished. They
are many. They are full of specious argument, personal
attack, appeal to the emotions, attempted pathos which
becomes bathos and genuine
<span title="&ecirc;thos" class="g">&#7974;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.
The speakers are true
to type: the impassioned lover, the leal friend, the
haughty, imperious, lustful noble, his sophistical lawyer,
the Aristophanic priest. Such agonistic scenes must have
entertained the reader of the time as much as they did the
author. Actually this same favorite rhetorical style is also
assigned to the characters in private life: Melitte in her
impassioned speech to Clitophon in prison talks like a
sophist, for Eros teaches even arguments!<a class="fn" id="fr_209" href="#fn_209">[209]</a></p>
<p>Long mythological narratives are another feature of
Tatius&rsquo; style. The sight of a painting makes it necessary
for him to relate the whole story of Procne and Philomela
to Leucippe.<a class="fn" id="fr_210" href="#fn_210">[210]</a> The stories of the origins of the two ordeals
to prove chastity are told with equal detail. The
discovery of wine is elaborately related in the Tyrian version
on the occasion of the festival of Dionysus.<a class="fn" id="fr_211" href="#fn_211">[211]</a> These
are a few out of many illustrations.</p>
<p>Descriptive writing is employed as much as, perhaps
more than, forensic or narrative. Indeed the purple
patches almost overbalance plot, conversation and oratory.
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Works of art, setting for scenes, natural phenomena, the
wonders of the world are introduced in highly colored digressions
which are clearly the ekphraseis which the students
of rhetoric were taught to compose and deliver.</p>
<p>Achilles Tatius apparently was enamored of wall-paintings.
He describes with gusto five and alludes to another.
The subjects of all are myths. Two are familiar types in
the frescoes found at Pompeii: Perseus and Andromeda,
Achilles in women&rsquo;s clothes among the daughters of King
Lycomedes. One description of a painting opens the romance,
a votive painting of Europa in the temple of Astarte
at Sidon.<a class="fn" id="fr_212" href="#fn_212">[212]</a> Sidon is the first word of the novel and this
story is introduced as a tribute to the city where the first
scene was laid, for the stemma on the coins of Sidon is
Europa on the bull, pictured almost as Tatius presents
her. The picture is described in vivid detail even to the
flowers in the meadow and the shifting colors of the sea.
Posture and garb of Europa are vividly sketched in words
for he sees her &ldquo;seated on the bull like a vessel under way,
using the veil as a sail.&rdquo; The keynote of the picture and
the point of its application for Tatius is the little flying
Eros who leads the bull and laughs back at the transformed
Zeus. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Clitophon, &ldquo;how that imp dominates
over land and sea.&rdquo; A young man standing by exclaims
that he too has suffered much from love. These exclamations
are the point of departure for the recounting of love
adventures.</p>
<p>In Book III there is an equally long description of a
painting by Evanthes in the temple of Zeus Casius.<a class="fn" id="fr_213" href="#fn_213">[213]</a> The
subjects are Andromeda and Prometheus and they seem
to have been paired because both were chained to rocks,
menaced by beasts and rescued by Argive heroes, Perseus
and Hercules. Design, color, emotion are all described
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
vividly and charmingly, but there is no point in the introduction
of the paintings. The description of them is
simply a purple patch of fine writing.</p>
<p>In Book V the description of a painting in a studio depicting
the rape of Philomela had &ldquo;a hidden significance.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_214" href="#fn_214">[214]</a>
The whole story was represented: &ldquo;the rape
of Philomela, the violence employed by Tereus, and the
cutting out of her tongue ... the tapestry, Tereus himself,
and the fatal table.&rdquo; Ugly realism, terror, insane
laughter characterize the treatment. The hidden meaning
is that the sudden sight of the picture is a bad omen
threatening disaster which makes Clitophon postpone his
journey to Pharos. The delay gives him a chance to tell
the whole story of Philomela to Leucippe, for all women
love myths.</p>
<p>Small works of art also are described lovingly and minutely:
a rock-crystal goblet carved in a grape-vine,<a class="fn" id="fr_215" href="#fn_215">[215]</a> a
jewelled necklace.<a class="fn" id="fr_216" href="#fn_216">[216]</a> These enrich the setting as scattered
flowers enrich the backgrounds of Renaissance tapestries.
It is as though Achilles Tatius like Corinthian potters or
Renaissance artists had such an <i>horror vacui</i> that empty
spaces in design were intolerable and interstices had to be
crowded with beautiful small objects. This is due in part
to an observant eye that saw and recorded detail. The
specific and the graphic are his tools for clarity. The
story of the attempted amour of Clitophon and Leucippe
is vivified by a plan of the house as clear as the drawn plans
in many modern detective stories.<a class="fn" id="fr_217" href="#fn_217">[217]</a> The garden in which
Clitophon&rsquo;s love-making is once set is described elaborately
with its porticoes, trees, vines, flowers, spring and birds.<a class="fn" id="fr_218" href="#fn_218">[218]</a>
The storm at sea in its violence and coloring is as lurid as a
Turner, and its effects on the shipwrecked passengers are
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
described with a true psychology of terror and panic.<a class="fn" id="fr_219" href="#fn_219">[219]</a></p>
<p>The long description of the storm is justified by the vital
significance of the shipwreck for the plot, but what of the
write-ups of the wonders of the world which are constantly
introduced? The beautiful description of Alexandria
with its pharos is brief and pardonable as this was the
birthplace of the author. But only the love of novelty of
the times and bad taste seem to explain the perpetrations
of wordy descriptions of the Nile, the phoenix, the hippopotamus,
the elephant and the crocodile!<a class="fn" id="fr_220" href="#fn_220">[220]</a> The romance
at times tends to become a natural history. Wolff
becomes so out of patience with &ldquo;the damnable iteration&rdquo;
of irrelevancies in <i>Clitophon and Leucippe</i> that he can
hardly calm himself to analyze them in suggestive groups:
irrelevancies of plot, of characterization, of setting, of science
and pseudo-science. The only justification for such
irrelevancies Wolff finds in &ldquo;a common basis with paradox.
Both defeat expectation.... In both its phases,&mdash;irrelevancy
and paradox&mdash;this element of <i>the unexpected</i>,
prominent in the form as in the matter of the Greek Romances,
deserves attention. To turn aside to the irrelevant;
to strain suspense by retarding the expected outcome;
to introduce by the way&mdash;all unlooked for&mdash;as
many bizarre, ironical, paradoxical situations and dazzling
phrases as possible; and finally to &lsquo;spring&rsquo; an issue which
is itself a surprising combination of opposites&mdash;all these
would seem to be consistent results of adopting the unexpected
as the principle of the genre.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_221" href="#fn_221">[221]</a></p>
<p>After all this is said in criticism of Achilles Tatius&rsquo; exuberant
style and unlimited digressions, we go back to his
fundamentals: a clear plot, living human beings, vivid
settings for them, and exciting adventures. Achilles Tatius
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
knew his age and for its disillusions he wrote with
ironic tolerance of human frailty and for its weariness he
emphasized the excitement of adventure and the stimulus
of the unexpected. To me his successes chalk up to a
longer list than his failures and I end with Phillimore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange thought&mdash;that an Alexandrian with the names
of Achilles Tatius (what a pair!), atticizing <i>con furore</i> in the reign
of Diocletian, should write a story which delighted the Byzantine
Middle Ages and can still be read with interest and amusement!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_222" href="#fn_222">[222]</a></p>

<h2 id="c6">VI
<br />THE LESBIAN PASTORALS OF DAPHNIS AND CHLOE
<br /><i>BY LONGUS</i></h2>
<p>The very title of Longus&rsquo; romance shows a new departure.
These Lesbian Pastorals in four books form the only pastoral
romance in Greek that is extant. Compared with
the other romances that of Longus is unique in type, characters,
setting and structure. Theocritus is the pervading
influence. Most of the leading characters are not nobles
but serfs. Even the young hero and heroine are brought
up as shepherds until at the end they are recognized as
children of the great. City life plays little part in the plot.
The changing seasons make the set. Only a few adventures
disturb the serenity of the hills and pasturelands:
an onset of pirates, a local war and (of course!) the usual
kidnappings. Country gods are worshipped. The music
of Pan&rsquo;s pipes is the accompaniment of the story.</p>
<p>Of the author we know nothing. Longus &ldquo;is not mentioned
by any other writer before the Byzantine age, and
himself mentions no historical name or event.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_223" href="#fn_223">[223]</a> From
internal evidence of his novel we see that he knew Mytilene
well; he was familiar with Greek and Roman literature
and with works of art; he had received a sophist&rsquo;s training
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
in the rhetorical schools. He wrote probably in the second
century <span class="small">A.D.</span>, before Achilles Tatius.</p>
<p>The early editions and translations show why Longus
was so influential in Elizabethan England and indeed in
the modern European literatures. The first edition of
the Greek text was published by the Junta Press in Florence
in 1598, but before that the romance had received its
first printing in Amyot&rsquo;s French translation in 1559 and
in the first English translation by Angell Daye in 1587.
This &ldquo;earliest English version&rdquo; which was dedicated to
Queen Elizabeth was more of an adaptation than a translation.
Its title-page demands perusal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Daphnis and Chloe excellently describing the weight of affection,
the simplicitie of love, the purport of honest meaning, the
resolution of men, and disposition of Fate, finished in a Pastorall,
and interlaced with the praises of a most peerlesse Princesse, wonderfull
in Maiestie, and rare in perfection, celebrated within the
same Pastorall, and therefore termed by the name of The Shepheards
Holidaie. By Angell Daye. Altior fortuna virtus.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title-page of the 1657 translation by &ldquo;Geo. Thornley,
Gent.&rdquo; was dubbed &ldquo;Daphnis and Chloe a most sweet
and pleasant pastoral romance for young ladies&rdquo; and it too
bore a Latin motto: &ldquo;Humili casa nihil antiquius nihil
nobilius.&mdash;Sen. Philos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this delightful old translation which J. M. Edmonds
&ldquo;revised and augmented&rdquo; in his version for <i>The Loeb
Classical Library</i> and in his introduction there Edmonds
says that this seems to have been George Thornley&rsquo;s only
publication. He was a sizar in Christ&rsquo;s College and received
his Bachelor in Arts from the University of Cambridge.
It is this translation of Edmonds-Thornley which
I shall use in my quotations.</p>
<p>Longus wrote a Prooimion to his romance which reveals
the occasion and the purpose of his writing. While hunting
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
in Lesbos he saw in a fair grove of the Nymphs a painted
picture which told a tale of ancient love.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There were figured in it young women, in the posture, some of
teeming, others of swaddling, little children; babes exposed, and
ewes giving them suck; shepherds taking up foundlings, young persons
plighting their troth; an incursion of thieves, an inroad of
armed men.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on studying the painting Longus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had a mighty instigation to write something as to answer that
picture. And therefore, when I had carefully sought and found an
interpreter of the image, I drew up these four books, an oblation to
Love and to Pan and to the Nymphs, and a delightful possession
even for all men. For this will cure him that is sick, and rouse him
that is in dumps; one that has loved, it will remember of it; one
that has not, it will instruct. For there was never any yet that
wholly could escape love, and never shall there be any, never so
long as beauty shall be, never so long as eyes can see. But help me
that God to write the passions of others; and while I write, keep
me in my own right wits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this delightful prayer, our humorous nympholept
Longus begins his story. We must now outline briefly his
four books of Pastorals.</p>
<p>The characters are:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><i>Daphnis</i>, a young goatherd</dt>
<dt><i>Lamo</i>, foster-father of Daphnis</dt>
<dt><i>Myrtale</i>, foster-mother of Daphnis</dt>
<dt><i>Chloe</i>, a young shepherdess</dt>
<dt><i>Dryas</i>, foster-father of Chloe</dt>
<dt><i>Nape</i>, foster-mother of Chloe</dt>
<dt><i>Dorco</i>, an oxherd</dt>
<dt><i>Philetas</i>, an aged shepherd and a famous piper</dt>
<dt><i>Lycaenium</i>, a city chit married to a swain</dt>
<dt><i>Dionysophanes</i>, lord of the manor</dt>
<dt><i>Clearista</i>, his wife</dt>
<dt><i>Astylus</i>, his son</dt>
<dt><i>Gnatho</i>, a parasite of Astylus</dt>
<dt><i>Lampis</i>, a herdsman</dt>
<dt>Tyrian pirates</dt>
<dt>Young nobles of Methymna</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>In Lesbos near Mytilene there was a great estate of a
great noble. On it once strange things happened for a
goatherd Lamo found a fine baby boy being nursed by a
she-goat. Purple was his cloak and near him was a little
golden sword with an ivory handle. Lamo and his wife
Myrtale reared the child and named him Daphnis. Two
years later another shepherd Dryas found in a cave sacred
to the nymphs and carved with pictures of them a baby
girl being nursed by a sheep. And beside her were little
possessions, a girdle embroidered in gold, gilded shoes,
golden anklets. Dryas and his wife reared the child and
named her Chloe. These are our hero and heroine.</p>
<p>Now when Daphnis was fifteen and Chloe thirteen, one
night both Lamo and Dryas had the same dream. The
nymphs of the cave appeared and gave Daphnis and Chloe
to a certain little winged boy with bow and arrow who
touched them with an arrow and ordered that Daphnis
tend a flock of goats and Chloe a flock of sheep. Their
parents were disappointed that they too were to become
herdsmen, for they had given the children a good education,
but they offered sacrifice in the cave to the Boy and
obeyed.</p>
<p>The year was at the spring. Birds were singing, lambs
gamboling, flowers blooming. The children too sang and
danced together and made garlands of flowers for the
Nymphs. All their joy and work they shared. But into
this paradise came danger. Trap-ditches had been set to
catch a marauding wolf and into one, as he pursued a he-goat,
fell Daphnis. He was drawn up all bloody and must
needs wash in the cave of the Nymphs. Chloe as she
washed his back thought she had never seen any-one so
fair or touched anything so soft. Love began here though
she knew it not.</p>
<p>Another danger menaced. Dorco an oxherd who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
helped draw Daphnis from the pit fell in love with Chloe
(he was a full-grown lad) and when he could not get her by
gifts, he and Daphnis held a contest of words for beauty
and Chloe was umpire. When their speeches were finished,
Chloe at once gave to Daphnis her prize&mdash;a kiss&mdash;and
that kiss made Daphnis fall in love though he did not
know what love was.</p>
<p>Defeated Dorco next appealed to Dryas for Chloe as a
wife, but Dryas rejected him. Then he tried a base trick.
He dressed up in a wolf-skin and hid near the spring where
the beasts watered, hoping to meet Chloe alone there.
This he did, but the sheep-dogs caught him first and would
have killed him had not Chloe and Daphnis saved him.
They thought Dorco&rsquo;s disguise was only a game, for they
never dreamed of rape in their innocence.</p>
<p>So through spring and summer Daphnis and Chloe
tended their flocks and played the pipes together. But in
the autumn Tyrian pirates descended on the shore to
raven. They wounded Dorco and stole his cows and kidnapped
Daphnis. Dorco dying gave his pipe to Chloe for
one kiss at last and bade her pipe his cows off the ship.
And the cows on hearing the call of the pipe jumped overboard
and swam ashore with Daphnis charioted between
two holding to their horns. The boat was upset and the
pirates who were all in armor drowned. Daphnis and
Chloe went to poor Dorco&rsquo;s funeral. They dedicated his
pipe to the Nymphs. They cheered their flocks who lay
mourning for Daphnis on the hills. And all went on as
before except that Daphnis&rsquo; heart ached,&mdash;why he did
not know.</p>
<p>Now (in Book II) came the time of vintage. These
charming children helped pick the grapes, tread the wine-press,
fill the vats with the new wine. That work done,
back to their flocks went Daphnis and Chloe. There old
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Philetas met them and sitting down told them a bright
story of how Eros had appeared to him in his garden, a
little winged boy flitting birdlike from tree to tree. And
Philetas tried to teach the children who Eros was and what
was his power, for Philetas had loved Amaryllis in his
youth. But though Philetas as a wise <i>praeceptor amoris</i>
instructed them thus: &ldquo;There is no medicine for love,
neither meat, nor drink, nor any charm, but only kissing
and embracing and lying side by side,&rdquo; the children did not
understand his teaching and played this game of love without
fulfillment. And as they exchanged childish kisses,
disaster again broke upon them.</p>
<p>Some young nobles of Methymna put in at the shore in
a gallant boat to make holiday, fishing and hunting with
their dogs. When a country fellow stole the rope that
tied up their ship, they carelessly made another of green
withes. Then their dogs while hunting frightened Daphnis&rsquo;
goats and drove them down to the shore and some finding
no other fodder ate up the green cable. At that a
strong wind off shore blew the boat out to sea to the great
rage of the young Methymnaean owners. They beat up
Daphnis in a fight with the peasants in which they too were
wounded and prosecuted him in court, but Philetas was
the presiding judge and acquitted the goatherd of any
wrong. The incensed young nobles made their way home
by land and persuaded Methymna to avenge their injuries
by sending a fleet to the land of Mytilene in an unannounced
war. The army plundered and devastated and
right from the sacred cave of the Nymphs kidnapped
Chloe. But such sacrilege was not to be unavenged by the
gods and the Nymphs appearing in a vision to distraught
Daphnis assured him that Pan would protect their votary.
And indeed Pan sent awful omens to the Methymnaeans:
the sound of the clashing of unseen weapons; the sight of
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
ivy sprouting on the horns of Daphnis&rsquo; stolen goats and of
a crown of pine placed on Chloe&rsquo;s head while all her
stolen sheep howled like wolves. And the sea had its marvels:
anchors stuck, oars broke, while a strange military
piping filled the air. Finally Pan appeared to the admiral
and demanded the return of the maid stolen from the altar
of the Nymphs and the return of her herds and flocks. So
the terrified commandant put about and restored Chloe
to the land. What a story she had to tell Daphnis! What
sacrifices and libations the rustics offered to Pan and the
Nymphs! Philetas too arrived to help them. Lamo told
them the story of the invention of Pan&rsquo;s pipes which a Sicilian
goatherd had sung to him. And on his own great
pipes Philetas played the different calls for the herds and
the song of Dionysus. Daphnis and Chloe acted out
Lamo&rsquo;s story of Pan and Syrinx. The next day back to
their flocks went the children and they talked now of their
love for each other and took mighty oaths of faithfulness
for life and death, Chloe swearing by the Nymphs, Daphnis
by Pan. But since Chloe knew Pan for an amorous and
faithless god, she made Daphnis take a second oath by the
trusty goats that he would match her faithfulness with his.</p>
<p>Now (in the beginning of Book III) war enters the story,
for the Mytilenaeans were incensed at the actions of the
Methymnaean fleet and sent a land expedition under Hippasus
for reparations. But this war was conducted in a
manner worthy of the golden age without ravaging of
country, with speedy offer of satisfaction, with cordial adjustment
of terms.</p>
<p>Winter now arrived, more bitter than war to Daphnis
and Chloe. Their flocks were shut in folds; they were
secluded in their separate farm-houses. But while Chloe
learned to spin and found no comfort, Daphnis built a
plan on hope. Braving the snow he struggled to a bird
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
center near Chloe&rsquo;s home, as if he went fowling. Yet
when he had reached his goal and snared many birds, he
dared not approach the farm-house for lack of excuse.
But Dryas chasing a dog who had stolen some meat rushed
out-doors, met Daphnis and brought him home.</p>
<p>Chloe in her glad surprise gave him a kiss; and all made
him welcome. Daphnis was persuaded to spend the night
to celebrate with them on the next day their sacrifice to
Dionysus. In the morning the lovers found a few moments
alone in which to renew their troth, and after that
Daphnis came often thither through the winter months.</p>
<p>Then spring came; the flocks were once more sent to
pasture. Daphnis and Chloe crowned their gods with
flowers and honored them with piping. They watched
the goats mate and wished to mate too, but knew not how.
A city woman, Lycaenium, married to a swain, heard their
childish talk and being half enamored of Daphnis undertook
to complete Philetas&rsquo; instruction in the art of love
and having had experience she taught him all. But he
put off using his new knowledge. Instead he told Chloe
the story of Echo.</p>
<p>Many suitors now wooed Chloe, and Daphnis in despair
told Myrtale, his foster-mother, how he too longed to wed
the girl, but his suit seemed hopeless until to desperate
Daphnis once more the Nymphs appeared and told him
where to find a purse of money that had been cast ashore
from the Methymnaean ship. With the three thousand
drachmae in it he won over Dryas and Nape, who in turn
persuaded his father and mother to accept the match. But
Lamo wished the marriage postponed until the lord of the
manor arrived in the autumn to give his consent. Now
that they were affianced Daphnis and Chloe waited happily.
Daphnis plucked for Chloe a golden apple that
hung unplucked on top of a tree, the best of all, a symbol of
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
the victory of love. And in return he received a kiss more
precious even than an apple of gold.</p>
<p>Now (in Book IV) with the autumn and the vintage the
lord Dionysophanes was coming with his wife Clearista to
inspect his estate. Lamo&rsquo;s pride was the beautiful garden
he had made, so it was a major disaster when a rejected
suitor of Chloe, churlish Lampis, devastated it for spite.
Lamo besought Astylus, son of Dionysophanes, to appease
his father&rsquo;s wrath and this he did.</p>
<p>Astylus had a rascally parasite Gnatho with him who
tried to corrupt Daphnis, but in vain; so hoping for the
future he persuaded Astylus to induce his father to take
Daphnis back to the city as his son&rsquo;s servant. At this menace
Lamo decided he must reveal Daphnis&rsquo; origin so he
brought out the tokens he had found with the child.
They proved that he was the son of Dionysophanes and
Clearista, exposed by them when they were young and
thoughtless and had too many children. So the young
shepherd was transformed into a prince and almost forgot
Chloe. Indeed while he was celebrating she was carried
off by Lampis, the herdsman. Gnatho, seeing Daphnis&rsquo;
despair, to reinstate himself, dashed off and rescued Chloe
just in time. Now her foster-parents produced her tokens
and her nobility too was assured. All went to Mytilene to
find Chloe&rsquo;s parents. The Nymphs and Eros appeared to
Dionysophanes in a dream and Eros bade him to make a
great marriage feast and there to display Chloe&rsquo;s tokens.
This he did and by them Chloe too found noble parents.
But Daphnis and Chloe chose to have a country wedding
and went back to the fields to their rustic friends.</p>
<p>Indeed most of their lives they lived there in the simple
way of shepherds, worshipping the Nymphs, Pan and Eros,
possessing great herds of sheep and goats, and for food
liking best of all apples and milk. There they had a son
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
and daughter whom a goat and a sheep nursed; Philopoemen
and Agelaea were their names. They made the
cave into a fair shrine, set up statues there, raised an altar
to Eros the shepherd and gave to Pan the soldier a temple
to dwell in instead of a pine. All this was long afterwards.
Now they had a rustic wedding. The shepherds played
their rude pipes for their Hymenaeus. Daphnis and
Chloe slept no more than the birds that night and Chloe
then first learned that all their love-making in the wood
was only the play of children.</p>
<p>This brief epitome of the plot shows its simplicity and
its coloring. The scene is pastoral and a unity of place
is observed which distinguishes the romance. All the
action takes place in the country near Mytilene. Only
for the episode of the search for Chloe&rsquo;s parents do the
characters move to the city and their sojourn there is
short.<a class="fn" id="fr_224" href="#fn_224">[224]</a> The main events of the plot are the double exposures,
the adoption and the recognitions of Daphnis and
Chloe and their common life as shepherds. The plot
contains the usual features of a romance but virtually all
are adapted to the pastoral tone and there is a change in
their relative importance. The chief interests are the
same as in the other romances: love, adventure, religion.
But love is in its springtime: it buds and blossoms in the
lives of two innocent children as the eternal miracle of nature.<a class="fn" id="fr_225" href="#fn_225">[225]</a>
The adventures are for the most part simple country
disasters: Daphnis falling into a trap-ditch set for a
wolf; a fair garden wantonly destroyed by a jealous rival.
There are to be sure two kidnappings, but the rescues are
speedy and magical. Daphnis is saved from the Tyrian
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
pirates by the music of a shepherd&rsquo;s pipe. Chloe&rsquo;s return
by the Methymnaeans is compelled by Pan himself. Even
war is conducted with noble generosity and given a peaceful
solution as if in a golden age.</p>
<p>Adventure indeed plays a far smaller part in the romance
than does religion. Worship is heartfelt and a part
of life. The gods honored are deities naturally worshipped
in the country: the Nymphs, Pan, Dionysus and Eros.
They are ever-present.</p>
<p>Longus in his Preface says that he made these four books
as a votive to Eros, the Nymphs and Pan. The baby girl
was exposed, nursed by a sheep and found by a shepherd
in the cave of the Nymphs.<a class="fn" id="fr_226" href="#fn_226">[226]</a> At critical moments in the
lives of the hero and heroine the Nymphs appear in visions
to guide or save. In Book I Lamo and Dryas, the foster-fathers,
had the same dream the same night: they saw the
Nymphs consign Daphnis and Chloe to the care of a young
winged boy who touched both with the same arrow and
bade each tend the flocks.<a class="fn" id="fr_227" href="#fn_227">[227]</a> After Chloe was kidnapped by
the Methymnaeans from the very cave of the Nymphs, the
three goddesses appeared to Daphnis in a vision by night
and told him not to fear, for Pan of the pine-tree would
rescue the maid.<a class="fn" id="fr_228" href="#fn_228">[228]</a> Again when for his poverty Daphnis
saw that Chloe was to be betrothed to some richer suitor,
the Nymphs appeared and told him where to find a purse
of silver.<a class="fn" id="fr_229" href="#fn_229">[229]</a> Finally Chloe&rsquo;s noble parentage was discovered
by the direction of the Nymphs and Eros who appeared
to Dionysophanes in his sleep and bade him make
a wedding feast in Mytilene and at it pass Chloe&rsquo;s tokens
about to all the guests.<a class="fn" id="fr_230" href="#fn_230">[230]</a></p>
<p>Such solicitous and tender care had been won by Daphnis
and Chloe through devotion. Out on the hills in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
morning first of all they saluted their gods. They gathered
flowers to crown their statues. They made them gifts
of grapes and apples or of pipe. They sacrificed to them
kids and lambs, and to the Nymphs and Pan they offered
constantly their prayers and vows. In the cave of the
Nymphs Chloe swore to share life and death with Daphnis.
Under the pine Daphnis swore by Pan that he would not
live a single day without Chloe.<a class="fn" id="fr_231" href="#fn_231">[231]</a></p>
<p>Eros is a less familiar god to the children, but through
Philetas&rsquo; instruction about the merry flying boy they come
to be his votaries.<a class="fn" id="fr_232" href="#fn_232">[232]</a> Dionysophanes gives all praise for
the care of the children to the united protection of Pan,
the Nymphs and Eros.<a class="fn" id="fr_233" href="#fn_233">[233]</a> The betrothal takes place before
the statues of the Nymphs.<a class="fn" id="fr_234" href="#fn_234">[234]</a> And all their lives
Daphnis and Chloe worshipped the Nymphs, Pan and Eros
for their very present help in time of trouble.<a class="fn" id="fr_235" href="#fn_235">[235]</a> This was
no formal ritual: it was a vital faith offered with clean
hands and a pure heart.</p>
<p>The worship of Dionysus also entered into the life of
the whole countryside. The song of the God of Wine
is played by Philetas and danced by Dryas. The festival
of Dionysus is celebrated by the sacrifice of a ram, a feast,
libations poured by ivy-crowned worshippers. In the
garden of the great estate of Dionysophanes there are an
altar and a shrine to the god, and the temple had paintings
about the life of Dionysus: Semele his mother, the sleeping
Ariadne, the binding of Lycurgus, the rending of
Pentheus, the conquered Indians, the transformed Tyrians,
Pan piping to those treading the wine-press and to
those dancing.<a class="fn" id="fr_236" href="#fn_236">[236]</a> On the first day after he arrived at his
estate Dionysophanes made sacrifice to this god for whom
he was named along with the other rural deities, Demeter,
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Pan, the Nymphs.<a class="fn" id="fr_237" href="#fn_237">[237]</a> And Daphnis for his happiness dedicated
his bag and cloak to Dionysus, to Pan his whistle and
his pipe, to the Nymphs his crook and milk-pails.<a class="fn" id="fr_238" href="#fn_238">[238]</a> The
god of the vintage must always have his share of honor in
the country.</p>
<p>So because the gods are omnipresent in country life, religion
is as much a part of the set of the romance as is locality.
For the monotony which might result from the
single background of the great estate near Mytilene in
Lesbos is varied not only by descriptions of fair garden,
pastures, trees, hills, seashore, but by the mystic vicinity of
the cave of the Nymphs, the pine-tree of Pan, the grapevine
of Dionysus and over all the unseen flying Eros shooting
his darts.</p>
<p>With such a setting, naturally the order of events follows
the seasons. In spring the story begins when the lad
of fifteen and the girl of thirteen are sent out to tend the
flocks in meadows and on hills. Summer brings the adventures
of the trap-ditch and the Tyrian pirates. Autumn
has its vintage and the menace of the Methymnaean
roisterers. Winter houses and separates the lovers until
Daphnis makes bold to go fowling. Spring returning,
Daphnis finds a purse and wins his shepherdess&rsquo; hand.
Summer passes in tending the flocks and making love.
Then as autumn again brings the vintage the lord of the
manor comes to his estate. There follows the recognition
of Daphnis as his son and soon Chloe is found to be as
noble. The weather is still fair, so after a royal feast in
the city, the wedding is celebrated in the country for their
hearts were rural.</p>
<p>Indeed the characters are for the most part country
wights: the worthy foster-parents, Chloe&rsquo;s suitors, Philetas
the wise old herdsman. They are all serfs and Daphnis
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
and Chloe were given pastoral names by their foster-parents
to make them seem truly theirs. They are noble
slaves full of hospitality and kindness. When corruption
menaces and brings temptation, it comes from the city.
Lycaenium is a young bride from the city. Gnatho is a
city parasite. Astylus, the son of Dionysophanes, although
he is a great-hearted youth who pities Lamo for the
destruction of his garden and welcomes his newly found
brother Daphnis with open arms, shows the effects of city
life by making his boon companion the worthless parasite
Gnatho whose only thoughts were of eating, drinking and
lechery. Dionysophanes is nobler than his son: though
gray-haired, he is still tall, handsome, able to wrestle with
young men, and though wealthy he is good. Indeed some
virtue must be attributed in this fairy-story even to the villains.
Dorco who tried to rape Chloe makes a beautiful
end by giving her his pipe and teaching her how to call the
cattle and Daphnis back from the raiders&rsquo; ship. Gnatho
redeems himself by rescuing Chloe from her second kidnapping.
And even Lampis, the rough herdsman, was
deemed worthy of forgiveness and invited to the wedding.
Daphnis and Chloe are brave, beautiful and virginal.
Chloe keeps her chastity to the end. Daphnis sins but
once, to learn what love is that he may teach his maid.</p>
<p>Dalmeyda has pointed out another striking feature of
the plot beside the unity of place and the strictly pastoral
coloring. This is its two-part division of which the first
might be entitled &ldquo;the search for love&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;the
marriage of Chloe.&rdquo; The first part ends with the lesson
of Lycaenium, the second with the country wedding.<a class="fn" id="fr_239" href="#fn_239">[239]</a></p>
<p>Within this two-part division and the unified pastoral
scene, the usual devices are employed for the pattern of
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
the romance, conversation, soliloquies, oaths, court-room
speeches, happy ending, but all are simplified to a country
standard. Typical of what I mean is the breath-taking
conversation that the lovers secure alone after their winter
separation, <span title="log&ocirc;n homilia terpn&ecirc;" class="g">&lambda;&#8057;&gamma;&omega;&nu; &#8001;&mu;&iota;&lambda;&#8055;&alpha; &tau;&epsilon;&rho;&pi;&nu;&#8053;</span>.<a class="fn" id="fr_240" href="#fn_240">[240]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Chloe, I came for thy sake.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know it, Daphnis.&rdquo;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis long of thee that I destroy the poor birds.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
wilt thou with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember me.&rdquo; &ldquo;I remember
thee, by the Nymphs by whom heretofore I have sworn in
yonder cave, whither we will go as soon as ever the snow
melts.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it lies very deep, Chloe, and I fear I shall
melt before the snow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Courage, man; the Sun burns
hot.&rdquo; &ldquo;I would it burnt like that fire which now burns
my very heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;You do but gibe and cozen me!&rdquo; &ldquo;I
do not, by the goats by which thou didst once bid me to
swear to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soliloquies too are as artless and simple as this talk.
At some emotional crisis the youngsters bemoan to themselves
their lot. Chloe, falling in love with Daphnis when
she sees him bathe in the cave of the Nymphs, laments the
pain in her heart that is worse than a bee-sting.<a class="fn" id="fr_241" href="#fn_241">[241]</a> After
Daphnis has been recognized as the son of the great Dionysophanes,
Chloe weeps at being forgotten, is sure Daphnis
is breaking his oath of faithfulness and bids him farewell
since she will surely die.<a class="fn" id="fr_242" href="#fn_242">[242]</a> Daphnis makes moan more
often. When the kiss of Chloe has set him on fire, he complains
that his heart leaps up; his soul is weakened; he
will waste away with his strange malady.<a class="fn" id="fr_243" href="#fn_243">[243]</a> Over the
sleeping Chloe he murmurs a soft rhapsody.<a class="fn" id="fr_244" href="#fn_244">[244]</a> Shut in
alone by winter he takes counsel with himself on what excuse
to end their separation.<a class="fn" id="fr_245" href="#fn_245">[245]</a> And when he hears that
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
Lampis has carried Chloe off, he seeks solitude in the garden
and rails at his bitter loss.<a class="fn" id="fr_246" href="#fn_246">[246]</a> Even the court-room
speeches in the prosecution of Daphnis by the Methymnaeans
for the loss of their ship are reduced to short and
simple arguments since a herdsman sat as judge.<a class="fn" id="fr_247" href="#fn_247">[247]</a> The
trial of course ends happily for Daphnis as must inevitably
the whole story. Of all the love romances this springtime
love in the country is the most joyous.</p>
<p>As we read this pastoral romance, the unknown author
becomes to us a real personality. His delight in the country
is spontaneous and real. He is a cultured person with
genuine appreciation of art, music and literature. Their
influence enriches his story. Longus in his preface tells
how a painting which he chanced to see in the grove of the
Nymphs gave the inspiration for the writing of his novel,
for the painting pictured a history of love and he longed to
write something that would correspond to the picture.
Paintings again he mentions in his description of a shrine
of Dionysus, paintings telling all the myths of the god.<a class="fn" id="fr_248" href="#fn_248">[248]</a>
The images of the Nymphs in the cave are described carefully
by him: cut out of the rock they were, feet unshod,
arms bare to the shoulders, hair falling on their necks,
their garments belted, a smile in their eyes.<a class="fn" id="fr_249" href="#fn_249">[249]</a> A statue of
Pan stood under his sacred pine until at the end Daphnis
and Chloe built him a shrine.<a class="fn" id="fr_250" href="#fn_250">[250]</a> Over and over these representations
are referred to as symbols of very present
gods.</p>
<p>The music that fills the romance is the sound of the
shepherds&rsquo; pipes and the voice of song. Daphnis makes a
pipe of reeds and teaches Chloe how to play on it.<a class="fn" id="fr_251" href="#fn_251">[251]</a> So
well did she learn that on Dorco&rsquo;s pipe she could call the
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
cattle back from the raiders&rsquo; ship.<a class="fn" id="fr_252" href="#fn_252">[252]</a> When spring brought
them out-doors, both Daphnis and Chloe challenged the
nightingales with their piping and the birds answered.<a class="fn" id="fr_253" href="#fn_253">[253]</a>
Philetas the old herdsman outdid all in playing on the
great organ-pipe of his father. He played special strains
for cows and oxen, for goats, for sheep. He played too
the melody of Dionysus and to it Dryas footed the dance of
the vintage. Daphnis too played on Philetas&rsquo; pipe a love-song
and danced with Chloe the story of the origin of the
pipe, Pan&rsquo;s wooing of the maid Syrinx.<a class="fn" id="fr_254" href="#fn_254">[254]</a></p>
<p>Daphnis displayed his art for his own father and mother,
before he was recognized as their son, to do them pleasure.
He blew the call of the goats; he blew their soft lullaby;
he blew their grazing tune; he blew the alarm for a wolf;
he blew the recall. And the goats responded to all his
different strains.<a class="fn" id="fr_255" href="#fn_255">[255]</a> After the wedding the shepherds
piped the bride and groom to bed and sang outside their
door a rude, harsh song, no Hymenaeus, but such as they
were wont to sing when with their picks they broke the
earth.<a class="fn" id="fr_256" href="#fn_256">[256]</a> For country people sang at all their tasks: the
boatman on the river,<a class="fn" id="fr_257" href="#fn_257">[257]</a> the herdsman in the pastureland.</p>
<p>More pervasive than all other influences in the romance
is the literary. Theocritus colors the whole story. There
are a few reminiscences of Bion<a class="fn" id="fr_258" href="#fn_258">[258]</a> and Moschus,<a class="fn" id="fr_259" href="#fn_259">[259]</a> but it
was the Sicilian goatherd par excellence who instructed
Longus as he did Lamo in his story.<a class="fn" id="fr_260" href="#fn_260">[260]</a> Calderini shows
the various traces of the inspiration which Longus received
from the Alexandrian idyl. There is a continuous alternation
of descriptions of nature with descriptions of emotion
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
all composed with a certain serenity and restraint.
The pain is not too violent; the descriptions of nature are
not too detailed or pedantic. There are many special
similar motives: the descriptions of paintings and statues;
the fear and the protection of Pan and the Nymphs;
the vengeance of Eros on those who scorn him; the young
lovers who frequent the gymnasia and the palestra; love
which is born on the day of a festival; the woe of love; the
violent, brutal love of a scorned shepherd; the patron who
lives at a distance.<a class="fn" id="fr_261" href="#fn_261">[261]</a> The pastoral name Daphnis is taken
from the ideal shepherd of Theocritus and Vergil. Pastoral
setting and pastoral narrative have the flavor of Theocritus.
Episodes are identical: Chloe plaits a tiny cage
for a grasshopper as did the young lad carved on the bowl
of ivy-wood.<a class="fn" id="fr_262" href="#fn_262">[262]</a> Daphnis and Chloe as they sit kissing each
other on the hill see a fisherman&rsquo;s boat passing on the sea
and listen to his song.<a class="fn" id="fr_263" href="#fn_263">[263]</a> So in Theocritus lovers on the
land embracing look out at the far distant sea.<a class="fn" id="fr_264" href="#fn_264">[264]</a> But
above all, Longus saw as Theocritus did that in the lives of
herdsmen lay true romance, and while Theocritus sang his
short lays, closely affiliated with the mimes in their use of
the comic, Longus lifted the love of goatherd and shepherd
to the realm of pure fiction by idealization and tenderness.
His originality was in making young love grow
with the seasons to maturity. The name of his heroine,
Chloe, a young green shoot, is symbolic of this growing
life.<a class="fn" id="fr_265" href="#fn_265">[265]</a> His awareness of his unique contribution to romance
perhaps appears in his title: <i>The Lesbian Pastorals
of Daphnis and Chloe</i>.</p>
<p>Sappho too was known and cherished by Longus.
There is a possible reminiscence in the description of
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Daphnis turning paler than grass in its season.<a class="fn" id="fr_266" href="#fn_266">[266]</a> There is
a sure reminiscence of Sappho&rsquo;s hyacinth on the mountains
crushed by the feet of the passing shepherds in Lamo&rsquo;s
pity for his flowers trodden down by a marauder.<a class="fn" id="fr_267" href="#fn_267">[267]</a> And
to Sappho Longus owes the climax of Daphnis&rsquo; wooing at
the end of Book III when he pulls &ldquo;the sweet apple which
reddens upon the topmost bough,&rdquo; saved by Fortune for a
shepherd in love, and putting it in Chloe&rsquo;s bosom makes
it a symbol of her beauty and his prize.<a class="fn" id="fr_268" href="#fn_268">[268]</a></p>
<p>Drama too had a definite influence on Longus, indeed the word
<span title="drama" class="g">&delta;&rho;&#8118;&mu;&alpha;</span>
or <span title="dramatikon" class="g">&delta;&rho;&alpha;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8057;&nu;</span>
is applied to these romances by
Photius.<a class="fn" id="fr_269" href="#fn_269">[269]</a> The two recognition scenes in which Daphnis
and Chloe find parents through the tokens placed with
them when they were exposed as babies are copied from
tragedy. New Comedy furnished at least three characters
to the romance, Gnatho the parasite, Sophrone the nurse
who exposed the baby Daphnis<a class="fn" id="fr_270" href="#fn_270">[270]</a> and the city wench, Lycaenium.
Elegiac poetry furnished Philetas, the father
perhaps of erotic elegiacs. Echo repeating the name of
Amaryllis suggests Vergil.<a class="fn" id="fr_271" href="#fn_271">[271]</a> And Ovid perhaps contributed
three names: Astylus, Dryas and Nape.<a class="fn" id="fr_272" href="#fn_272">[272]</a> The influence
of the rhetorical schools is slighter than in the other
romances, but appears in the court-room scene with its
speeches and in the use of parallelism and contrast. Parallelism,
as Calderini says,<a class="fn" id="fr_273" href="#fn_273">[273]</a> includes all the plot of the romance
and proceeds from the number and selection of
the characters to the variety of the secondary episodes and
to the description of the smallest details. Daphnis and
Chloe are both exposed, both rescued by shepherds. Both
are kidnapped. An attack on Chloe is made by Dorco,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
on Daphnis by Gnatho. Chloe touches Daphnis when he
is bathing and falls in love. Daphnis kisses Chloe and his
heart rises to his lips. Astylus, the city son of Dionysophanes,
is sophisticated, Daphnis is virginal. The oath
of Daphnis is matched by the oath of Chloe. On and on
proceeds this balancing. And the parallelism appears not
only in plot, but in details of phrase and sentence structure:
balanced rhythmical phrases set off by rhymes or
alliterations; bipartite or tripartite periods, elaborate in
their rhetorical structure. Sometimes indeed Longus&rsquo;
Pastorals seem written in modern verse, indeed they are
written in poetic prose.<a class="fn" id="fr_274" href="#fn_274">[274]</a></p>
<p>Out of all these interests in art, music and literature
and beyond them Longus has created a style peculiarly his
own and suited to his pastoral romance. His sentence
structure is simple and paratactic. His comparisons are
drawn from the life of shepherds. Chloe is as restive as
a heifer.<a class="fn" id="fr_275" href="#fn_275">[275]</a> Dorco claims he is as white as milk but Daphnis
says Dorco is as red as a fox.<a class="fn" id="fr_276" href="#fn_276">[276]</a> Daphnis and Chloe run
about like dogs freed from their leashes.<a class="fn" id="fr_277" href="#fn_277">[277]</a> Chloe plunders
from Daphnis&rsquo; mouth a bit of cake as though she were a
young bird being fed.<a class="fn" id="fr_278" href="#fn_278">[278]</a></p>
<p>Description and narration are as vivid as these little
similes. We are made to see Daphnis at his bath: his
hair black and thick, his body sun-burned dark as though
colored by the shadow of his hair;<a class="fn" id="fr_279" href="#fn_279">[279]</a> the coming of spring
with flowers covering the valleys and the mountains, bees
humming, birds warbling, lambs gamboling; the vintage
scene with the peasants all busy in the vineyard with the
wine-presses, the hogsheads, the baskets, and the grapes;<a class="fn" id="fr_280" href="#fn_280">[280]</a>
the winter landscape with the deep snow, the rushing torrents,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
the ice, the laden trees;<a class="fn" id="fr_281" href="#fn_281">[281]</a> the country wedding with
the feast on beds of green boughs before the cave of the
Nymphs, the songs of the reapers and the vintners, the
dancing to the pipes, the goats sharing the feast, the bridal
procession with its piping and singing.<a class="fn" id="fr_282" href="#fn_282">[282]</a></p>
<p>Longus&rsquo; art of narration is employed as skillfully as are
his descriptions. This art appears not only in the pattern
of the whole romance, but in the skillful use of stories
within the story to diversify and enliven the longer narrative.
After the feast of Dionysus, the old men, their
tongues loosed with wine, fell into reminiscence and told
tales to each other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;how bravely in their youth they had administered the pasturing
of their flocks and herds, how in their time they had escaped very
many invasions and inroads of pirates and thieves. Here one
bragged that he had killed a wolf, here another that he had bin second
to Pan alone in the skill and art of piping.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_283" href="#fn_283">[283]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last was Philetas, the wise old shepherd who told
Daphnis and Chloe the story of the gay little Eros whom
he had found playing in his garden flying like a nightingale
from bough to bough of the myrtles, a lovely story with a
point for Philetas&rsquo; <i>ars amatoria</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_284" href="#fn_284">[284]</a> The other inset stories
are mostly short myths. So Daphnis tells Chloe how the
mourning dove was once a maid, very proud of her singing
and by her song alone she kept the cows she tended
near her in the wood. But a shepherd lad rivalled her
music and piped off eight of her finest cows to his own
herd. And the girl in despair prayed to become a bird.
The gods consented and left her that sweet voice so still
she calls the cattle home.<a class="fn" id="fr_285" href="#fn_285">[285]</a></p>
<p>At the feast of Dionysus Lamo tells a myth which a
Sicilian goatherd had sung to him, a tiny tale of how the
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
girl Syrinx fleeing Pan&rsquo;s embraces was changed into a reed
and then made by Pan into his pipe, with reeds of unequal
lengths to symbolize their ill-matched love.<a class="fn" id="fr_286" href="#fn_286">[286]</a> All
these stories are very short and simple, bits of folk-lore
such as peasants might relate at their feasts or in the open.</p>
<p>Much of the whole narrative is colored by a humor that
is as playful and tender as the spirit of Philetas&rsquo; merry
child Eros. In the vintage scene both Daphnis and Chloe
are beset with childish jealousy at the attentions that each
other receives.<a class="fn" id="fr_287" href="#fn_287">[287]</a> The author&rsquo;s humor plays around them
from the time when they first herded their flocks together
to the day of their rural wedding. And the plot is set with
humor, which as Wolff observes, turns on &ldquo;the incongruity
between the children&rsquo;s innocence and the piquancy of their
experiments.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_288" href="#fn_288">[288]</a></p>
<p>It is not strange that Longus&rsquo; Pastorals with all their
charm of plot, setting and style were the forerunners of
much later literature. Todd has a paragraph which is a
sign-post to the line of his successors.<a class="fn" id="fr_289" href="#fn_289">[289]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Longus invented the pastoral romance, and his influence is
found throughout the pastorals of the modern European literatures:
already, perhaps, at the end of the fifteenth century, in the
<i>Arcadia</i> of the &lsquo;Neapolitan Virgil&rsquo; Jacopo Sannazaro; in the
<i>Aminta</i> of Tasso, in the <i>Astr&eacute;e</i> of D&rsquo;Urf&eacute;, in the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>
of Ramsay, in the <i>Paul et Virginie</i> of Saint-Pierre, and in other
writings almost countless.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>S. L. Wolff&rsquo;s elaborate study of <i>The Greek Romances in
Elizabethan Prose Fiction</i> analyzes in detail Longus&rsquo; influence
on Robert Greene in <i>Manaphon</i> and <i>Pandost</i> and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s use of Longus in the pastoral setting, the
hunt scene, the exposure motif in <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>.
There is rich material still left in the study of the Greek
Romances for the young scholar working in Comparative
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
Literature. By them, by all students of literature <i>Daphnis
and Chloe</i> deserves to be read and reread. For Longus,
just as Theocritus did in the Idyl, immortalized in the
realm of fiction the loves and woes of shepherds.</p>
<p>It is strange that a pastoral romance of such honest and
simple charm should have played a dramatic part in a
melodrama of the early nineteenth century. Yet it did,
for it almost caused an international literary warfare; it
almost had a French officer shot for desertion; and it
created serious political complications for him with the
Bonaparte family.</p>
<p>Paul Louis Courier (1773-1825) led a bizarre life as a
vine-grower, an officer in the artillery, a liberal pamphleteer,
a member of the Legion of Honor, a prisoner in Sainte-P&eacute;lagie,
a traveller, a poet, a Hellenist. Throughout his
checkered career, he anticipated Byron in his romantic
passion for the antiquities, the ruins, the beauty of Greece.
In 1811 he wrote from Rome: &ldquo;The fact is that I wish
before I die to see the lantern of Demosthenes and drink
the water of the Ilissus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was this passion combined with his disgust at the
butcheries of Wagram that made him forget that he was
a soldier so that in 1809, though he was the head of a
squadron of artillery, he slipped out of military life and
in Italy devoted all his time to those literary studies to
which before he had given his leisure.</p>
<p>Reared in the country (at M&eacute;r&eacute; in Touraine), he had
early become fascinated with the pastoral romance <i>Daphnis
and Chloe</i> and now he was determined to work on
a Thirteenth Century Greek manuscript of it which was in
the Laurentian Library. After some difficulty he obtained
permission from the librarian, Francesco Furia, and
his work started happily. It was to meet with the greatest
success and the greatest disaster. Courier, amateur that
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
he was, discovered that the Laurentian manuscript contained
the text of the great lacuna in Book I (cc. 12-17).
These chapters were lacking in all other manuscripts.
Furia who had worked for years on the manuscript, which
was in parts nearly illegible, had never noticed these hitherto
unknown chapters. They contain the episode of
Daphnis tumbling into the trap-ditch, Chloe&rsquo;s falling in
love with him thereafter, and the contest of Daphnis and
Dorco for Chloe&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
<p>Close on Courier&rsquo;s great discovery followed a most unfortunate
episode, for after carefully copying the new
chapters Courier obliterated them by a black ink stain.
It was natural that the jealous Furia should believe
that Courier had intentionally upset his ink-pot over them.
Courier himself in a letter to Renouard declared that inadvertently
he had used as a marker some paper which
was soaked in ink on the under side, and that made the
blot.</p>
<p>The rage of Furia might itself have hindered the
publication of Courier&rsquo;s discovery and now a political
complication arose as a new obstacle. Since the fame of
his work was spreading, Elisa Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon,
wished to have Courier&rsquo;s publication dedicated to
her and the prefect of Florence, the Baron Fauchet, announced
her gracious wish at a formal dinner-party!
Courier, who by now hated all Bonapartes, cut his Gordian
knot by rushing out at Florence a Greek edition in fifty-two
copies before the French edition which he was publishing
at Paris appeared in 1810. The deed was done and
neither Furia nor la Bonaparte could undo it.</p>
<p>The fame and scandal of Courier&rsquo;s work of course came
to the ears of the Ministry of War and orders were sent to
General Sorbier, commandant of the artillery in Italy, to
demand from Courier explanations of his absence from
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
his squadron. Fortunately the general accepted Courier&rsquo;s
affirmation that he had never thought of deserting so that
the Hellenist escaped being shot then, but fate pursued
him.</p>
<p>On April 11, 1825, the body of Paul Louis Courier was
found in a wood near his country home at V&eacute;retz. He had
been assassinated. It was long believed that this was a
political crime, &ldquo;a kind of epilogue of secret vengeance
in party politics&rdquo; as Edmond Pilon puts it.<a class="fn" id="fr_290" href="#fn_290">[290]</a> It might also
have been the revenge of a philologist. Actually the shooting
was the result of an embroglio with certain servants on
his estate. Courier in 1814 had married Mlle Herminie
Clavier, who managed his estate in his absence. She seems
to have betrayed him both in business matters and affairs
of the heart so that Courier separated from her and made
new plans for the management of the estate. Five years
after the murder the Department of Justice found that the
assassins were certain servitors of Courier who had been
dismissed because of their connivance with Madame Courier
in her iniquities. Courier, whose dearest dream had
been the pastoral life of Daphnis and Chloe, escaped the
dangers of war and of prison only to be shot in the country
he loved for petty personal spite.</p>
<p>Paul Louis Courier would, I am sure, have been happy
to have part of his fame rest on his precious new chapters
of the Pastorals, and to know that his beautiful translation
of their four books lives on in one new edition after another.</p>

<br /><i>LUCIAN AND HIS SATIRIC ROMANCES: THE</i> TRUE HISTORY <i>AND</i> LUCIUS OR ASS</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lucian of Samosata [was] surnamed &lsquo;The blasphemer,&rsquo; because
in his dialogues he alleges that the things told of the gods are absurd....
He was at first an advocate in Antioch, but, having ill success
in that, he turned to the composition of discourses, and his
writings are innumerable. He is said to have been killed by dogs,
he having been rabid against the truth. For in his &lsquo;Life of Peregrinus&rsquo;
he attacks Christianity and, wicked man, blasphemes
against Christ himself. Wherefore for his madness he suffered
meet punishment in this life, and hereafter with Satan he will be
inheritor of the everlasting fire.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_291" href="#fn_291">[291]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the meagre biography by Suidas of the great satirist
who through nearly all of the second century held up the
mirror of his frankness to reflect images of the Greek and
Roman world. Suidas&rsquo; misrepresentation of Lucian&rsquo;s allusions
to the Christians and his fanciful picture of the
sophist&rsquo;s end vilify much of this traditional vita. From
Lucian&rsquo;s own writings more facts may be assembled.</p>
<p>Syrian by birth, he wrote in Greek and became a master
of an Attic prose style. As a boy he was apprenticed to
a sculptor uncle, but quickly left work with his hands for
work with his tongue, studied rhetoric and oratory, practiced
as an advocate at Antioch, became a professional
sophist and travelled in Asia Minor, Macedonia, Greece,
Italy, Gaul; about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 165 settled at Athens where he lived
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
twenty years, then near the end of his life took an official
post in Egypt under the Emperor and wrote an Apology
for so doing. Suidas&rsquo; description of his writings as &ldquo;innumerable&rdquo;
seems justified by the eighty-two prose works
extant to say nothing of two mock tragedies and fifty-three
epigrams, now considered spurious.</p>
<p>Though the great bulk of Lucian&rsquo;s writings consists of
Platonic and satiric dialogues, he enters into the scope of
this book as a writer of the satiric or parody romance. For
two of his writings, the <i>True History</i> and <i>Lucius or Ass</i>,
establish for us this new type of Greek romance. His
<i>True History</i> is a parody of all travellers&rsquo; tales from Odysseus&rsquo;
to such as those of Antonius Diogenes in <i>The Wonderful
Things beyond Thule</i>. Probably this work of
Lucian had more literary influence than any of his other
writings. His other romance, of which we have only an
epitome, <i>Lucius or Ass</i>, is, I believe, a parody of the romance
motivated mainly by religion. Its greatest value
in its present syncopated form is that it outlines a contemporary
Greek counterpart of the famous Latin novel,
Apuleius&rsquo; <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and furnishes us with a touchstone
for testing the pure gold of Apuleius&rsquo; originality.</p>
<p>Before, however, we can discuss Lucian&rsquo;s art of narration
in his two romances, we must reconstruct from his own
writings his literary autobiography and his conceptions of
his literary art. Only then when we have met the critic
self-criticized will we be competent to appreciate his brilliant
imaginative flights in his novels.</p>
<p>A dangerous temptation at once assails any one who
starts to write on any subject connected with Lucian.
That is to attempt to cover the whole field of his life and
works because of the brilliancy of the many-sided facets of
his genius. A forcible deterrent is the fact that a masterly
appreciation of <i>La vie et les &oelig;uvres de Lucien</i> has
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
already been written by Maurice Croiset in his <i>Essai</i><a class="fn" id="fr_292" href="#fn_292">[292]</a>
which in richness and style alike is worthy of its great
theme. All subsequent studies of Lucian are inevitably
founded on M. Croiset&rsquo;s appreciation.</p>
<p>Gildersleeve, following Croiset, pointed out that Lucian&rsquo;s
life must be reconstructed from his own writings.
And this within the scope of a brief essay Gildersleeve did
brilliantly for English readers fifty years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_293" href="#fn_293">[293]</a> From another
angle I am attempting to do this same thing now
in order to make us acquainted before we read his stories
with Lucian the story-teller.<a class="fn" id="fr_294" href="#fn_294">[294]</a></p>
<p>Lucian&rsquo;s early life is pictured in a brief speech called
<i>The Dream</i>. This was probably delivered in his native
Syria on his return after his European lecture-tour which
made him famous as a Sophist. In a whimsical mixture
of fact and fancy he describes his choice of a career. As
a young lad when he had just finished school, Lucian was
apprenticed to his mother&rsquo;s brother, a sculptor, to learn to
be &ldquo;a good stone-cutter, mason and sculptor.&rdquo; On his first
day he struck a slab of marble so hard that he shattered
it. Whereat his uncle gave him such a violent beating
that he ran home to his mother for comfort. That night
he had a vision. Two women were struggling to get possession
of him. They were vastly different in appearance
and in the appeals they made to him, for they were Sculpture
and Education. Sculpture, unkempt, speaking haltingly
and like a barbarian, told Lucian that if he came to
her, he would live well, have strong shoulders, would never
go abroad, but would gain such fame as surrounded Phidias,
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
Polyclitus, Myron, Praxiteles. Education in her
turn assured him that even if he became a famous sculptor,
he would be only a mechanic, living by his hands; she
herself has much more to offer him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you follow my advice, first of all I shall show you many works
of men of old, tell you their wondrous deeds and words, and make
you conversant with almost all knowledge, and I shall ornament
your soul, which concerns you most, with many noble adornments&mdash;temperance,
justice, piety, kindliness, reasonableness, understanding,
steadfastness, love of all that is beautiful, ardour towards
all that is sublime; for these are the truly flawless jewels of the
soul. Nothing that came to pass of old will escape you, and nothing
that must now come to pass; nay, you will even foresee the future
with me. In a word, I shall speedily teach you everything
that there is, whether it pertains to the gods or to man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_295" href="#fn_295">[295]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, he will dress with distinction, will speak with
eloquence. Finally he may became as famous as Demosthenes
or Aeschines. He must recall that Socrates left
sculpture for philosophy.</p>
<p>Lucian on hearing these two appeals gave himself to
Education, who then took him in a car with winged horses
and from the air showed him the cities and peoples of the
world. After this vision she clothed him suitably and
returned him to his home. Lucian says he has told this
dream &ldquo;in order that those who are young may take the
better direction and cleave to education, above all if poverty
is making any one of them faint-hearted.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_296" href="#fn_296">[296]</a></p>
<p>Now although this choice of Lucian is based on the
choice of Hercules<a class="fn" id="fr_297" href="#fn_297">[297]</a> and although facts are clothed in
fantasy, the picture of Lucian&rsquo;s early apprenticeship may
well be true, for the boy&rsquo;s delight in modelling little figures
of wax seems to forecast Lucian&rsquo;s life-long interest in sculpture
and other art forms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The next crisis in Lucian&rsquo;s literary life is depicted in
<i>The Double Indictment</i>, a dialogue composed when the
author was forty. In it Lucian appears in court to answer
two charges: one of the rhetoricians, for giving up speech-making
and essay-writing; the other of the philosophers,
for using their sacred Platonic dialogue for satire. Lucian&rsquo;s
trial takes place on the Areopagus with Justice presiding,
but the dialogue opens in heaven with a long complaint
by Zeus about the hard life of the gods especially
his own, no time for anything. Hermes who is listening
tells him frankly that there are many complaints among
mortals on earth because of the slowness of the law courts.
Zeus then sends Hermes down to proclaim a session and
orders Justice to preside at it.</p>
<p>At this court, after various cases have been wittily disposed
of, the Syrian is called to face two indictments:
Oratory versus the Syrian for neglect, Dialogue versus the
Syrian for maltreatment. Oratory first relates how she
found the plaintiff as a lad wandering in Ionia, speaking
with a foreign accent, dressed as a Syrian. She educated
him and at his eager request married him although all his
dowry was wonderful speeches. Next she had him made
a citizen and then went travelling with him to Greece,
Ionia, Italy and Gaul. As he became famous, he grew
indifferent to her, for he was enamored of a bearded man,
Dialogue, said to be the son of Philosophy. Now he no
longer makes speeches, but has a strange way of using short
questions. She sues him for desertion. The Syrian replies
that all her facts are true, but there are others; she
lost her modesty, made up like a courtesan, flirted indiscriminately
with many lovers. So he separated from her
and went to live with a respectable gentleman, Dialogue.
The Syrian won the case.</p>
<p>Next Dialogue pleaded. His dignity, his cosmic
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
thoughts, his tragic mask have all been stolen from him.
He has been forced to associate with Jest, Satire, Cynicism,
Eupolis and Aristophanes, &ldquo;terrible men for mocking at all
that is holy and scoffing at all that is right,&rdquo; finally too
even with Menippus. He has been transformed into a
monster not homogeneous but Centaur-like. The Syrian
in reply showed the benefits which he had bestowed on
Dialogue: he taught him to walk like a man, to clean up,
to smile, to be yoked with Comedy. Dialogue resents
that the Syrian will not indulge in endless arguments on
subtle themes. The Syrian declares that he has not taken
off Dialogue&rsquo;s Greek cloak and put him into barbarian
garb: Dialogue is still dressed in his native Greek costume.
The Syrian was unanimously acquitted much to
the delight of the audience. This mock-trial picturesquely
portrays Lucian&rsquo;s change from writing the philosophical
dialogues in the style of Plato to the satiric dialogue, influenced
successively by New Attic Comedy, Menippus
and Old Attic Comedy.<a class="fn" id="fr_298" href="#fn_298">[298]</a> Lucian here is writing an Apology
for the new style of satire-dialogue which he created.</p>
<p>With similar wit but in various modes Lucian in other
pieces satirizes now Rhetoric, now Philosophy. An illuminating
series of such dialogues is <i>The Professor of Oratory</i>,
<i>Nigrinus</i>, <i>Philosophies for Sale</i>, <i>The Fisherman</i>.</p>
<p>In <i>The Professor of Oratory</i> ironic advice is given to a
young man on how to become an orator and a sophist.
The quest is noble and the way to success is not difficult.
The Lady Rhetoric sits fair and desirable on the top of a
high mountain attended by Wealth, Fame and Power.
Thither two roads lead. One is a narrow, steep and thorny
path, the other an easy slope amid flowers and fountains.
Two guides will present themselves to you. One, vigorous
and manly, will point out to you the hard way in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
footprints of Demosthenes and Plato and will tell how
severe the training must be for their followers. He will
wish, the simpleton, to make you model yourself on the
past.</p>
<p>The other guide is a pretty gentleman, daintily groomed
and perfumed, with an alluring smile and a honey voice.
He will tell you that you can become such an orator as
he is if you carry as equipment ignorance, boldness, shamelessness;
if you dress in bright, diaphanous robes and
always carry a book! Your course of study will be the
memorizing of a few stock words, a few learned references
for ornaments of your discourse. He will teach you a high
singsong chant and the art of always beginning with stories
from the Iliad.</p>
<p>Your fame will be secured by a well-trained chorus of
applauders in your audiences and by slanders of all your
rivals. In private life you must live fast with dice, wine
and women, so you come to be talked of as a deuce of a
fellow, and amours will increase your income. Thus you
will be fitted to be the bridegroom of Rhetoric by driving
furiously the winged chariot of which Plato wrote. Your
adviser is already getting out of your way, for he was defeated
when once you chose the primrose path. This
picture of <i>The Perfect Rhetorician</i> has been thought by
some critics to be a personal satire of the contemporary
lexicographer Pollux. However that may be, it is certainly
a satire of any pseudo-professor of rhetoric who bases
oratory on cheap externalities and superficial training.</p>
<p>At another time Lucian was to satirize pseudo-philosophers
as he had rhetoricians, but once, perhaps in the beginning
of revolt against rhetoric, he chose to picture a
noble type in the dialogue on Nigrinus, a philosopher unknown
except through Lucian. His great tribute to Nigrinus
may be set as a companion piece to the mocking
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
praise of <i>The Perfect Rhetorician</i>. The dialogue is prefaced
by an introductory letter in which Lucian tells Nigrinus
that he is not carrying owls to Athens in offering
him this book as if to display his use of words, but he is
sending it in thanks for Nigrinus&rsquo; words. In the dialogue
itself one man relates to another how by talking with Nigrinus
he was made free instead of a slave, poor instead
of rich. For Nigrinus praised philosophy and the freedom
it gives and ridiculed what men in general exalt: wealth,
fame, power, honor. Nigrinus praised Athens because
there Poverty and Philosophy are foster-brothers; there
life is free, noble, harmonious. Rome is the city for those
who love wealth and luxury, wine and women. The Romans
have given themselves over to the pleasures of the
senses and have every means of gratifying them. So Nigrinus
in Rome leads a life of retirement, conversing with
Philosophy and with Plato, reflecting on the ridiculous
rich, the parasites, the pseudo-philosophers, the will-hunters,
the gourmands, the frequenters of the circus
and the baths. No wonder men come to him for healing.</p>
<p>The tribute to Platonism here, the tribute to Epicurus
in <i>Alexander the False Prophet</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_299" href="#fn_299">[299]</a> might tempt readers to
affiliate Lucian with one or the other of these philosophical
schools. But as if to forestall being labelled, in the spirit
of Horace&rsquo;s famous line</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri,<a class="fn" id="fr_300" href="#fn_300">[300]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucian turns his satire on all the leading creeds of the
time in his <i>Philosophies for Sale</i>.</p>
<p>Zeus orders an auction of philosophies. Hermes acts
as crier and auctioneer. The buyer questions each person
who is put up for sale on his knowledge, on his creed,
on his use. A Pythagorean is put up first by Hermes who
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
asks: &ldquo;Who wishes to know about the harmony of the
world and re-birth?&rdquo; The Pythagorean attempts to expound
to the buyer the catharsis of the spirit, the need of
music and of geometry, the flux of the cosmos, the divinity
in numbers, the transmigration of souls. An Italian
bought him for a brotherhood in Magna Graecia for ten
minas.</p>
<p>A Cynic is next displayed, dirty, morose, ready to bark
at everyone. He declares that Hercules is his model and
that like Hercules he is a militant reformer, working to
clear the world of filth. He declares that he will teach his
purchaser to discard luxury, to endure hardship, to drink
only water, to throw his money into the sea, to reject all
family ties, to live in a tomb or a jar. So he will feel no
pain even when flogged and will be happier than the Great
King. He will be bold, abusive, savage, shameless. For
such a life no education is necessary. The Cynic is sold
for two obols.</p>
<p>The third called is the Cyrenaic, who appears clad in
purple and crowned with a wreath. Hermes announces
that his philosophy is the sweetest, indeed thrice blessed.
As the Cyrenaic is too drunk to answer questions, Hermes
describes his virtues: he is pleasant to live with, congenial
to drink with, a companion for amours, and an excellent
chef! There was no bid for him!</p>
<p>Next two are put up together, the one who laughs and
the one who cries. The first explains his laughter on the
ground that all men and all their affairs are ridiculous;
all things are folly, a mere drift of atoms. The weeper
pities men because their lives are foreordained and in them
nothing is stable; men themselves are mere pawns in the
game of eternity and the gods are only immortal men. No
one bids for the pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>An Academic next advertises his wares as a teacher of
the art of love, but claims that this love is of the soul, not
of the body. He affirms that he lives in a city fashioned
by himself, where wives are held in common, fair boys
are prizes for valor, and realities are ideas, visible only to
the wise. He was bought for two talents.</p>
<p>A pupil of the laugher and the drunkard is now offered
for sale, namely Epicurus. The mere description of him
as more irreverent than his teachers, charming, fond of
good eating, sells him for two minas.</p>
<p>The sad philosopher of the Porch is now announced by
Hermes who proclaims that he is selling virtue itself and
that the Stoic is &ldquo;the only wise man, the only handsome
man, the only just man, brave man, king, orator, rich man,
lawgiver, and everything else that there is.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_301" href="#fn_301">[301]</a> His talk
about himself is full of hair-splitting dialectics and subtle
explanations of why man must devote himself &ldquo;to the chief
natural goods ... wealth, health, and the like&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_301">[301]</a> and go
through much toil for much learning. In spite of all this
he is bought for twenty minas.</p>
<p>The Peripatetic is also sold for twenty minas because he
knows everything but the Sceptic brings in only one mina
because he knows nothing! The auction ends with the
announcement by Hermes of another sale the next day
of plain men, workmen, tradesmen.</p>
<p>Inevitably this ironic treatment of the great philosophies
of Greece produced a storm of criticism. This was answered
by Lucian in an apology of sorts under the title
<i>The Resurrected or The Fisherman</i>. In it the satirist under
the pseudonym of Frankness faces his accusers. For up
from the dead, led by a militant Socrates, come to Athens
Empedocles, Plato, Aristotle and other phantoms to execute
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
worthy dooms on the worst of maligners. Frankness
by rhetoric and argument averts stoning or crucifixion and
secures a fair trial, presided over by Philosophy, who is
attended by Truth, Investigation and Virtue. After Diogenes
makes the speech for the prosecution, Frankness replies
in defense of himself&mdash;and Lucian! He wins a
unanimous verdict for acquittal by his claim that he auctioned
off, not the great philosophers who now prosecute
him, but base impostors who imitate them. Syllogism
now acts as herald and calls from Athens to court all the
philosophers to defend themselves. Frankness by promising
largess secures a crowd of them, Platonists, Stoics,
Peripatetics, Epicureans, Academics. When Philosophy
announces that they are to be tried as impostors by herself,
Virtue and Truth, they all disappear in wild rout. To get
them back, Frankness now becomes a fisherman and, with
bait of gold, hooks and hauls back the craven cheats. The
head of each school disowns his imitators and the discarded
are thrown down over the cliffs. Finally Philosophy dismisses
the court with an injunction to Frankness to keep
investigating philosophers in order to crown the true and
brand the false.</p>
<p>The genial tone of <i>Philosophies for Sale</i> has entirely
vanished in the essay on <i>The End of Peregrinus</i>. The
influence of New Comedy and of Menippus with their
ironic raillery is superseded by Aristophanic denunciation.
Bitter mockery, cruel derision are loosed upon one
creed, the Cynic. Lucian directs his vituperation against
the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus, whose career had been
meteoric. In his early life he was converted to Christianity,
and even went to prison for his faith. Later, beliefs
of India so possessed him that he immolated himself at
Olympia just after the Olympic games of <span class="small">A.D.</span> 165. Such
self-sacrifice by cremation had been consummated at Susa
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
by Calanus before Alexander the Great and by Zarmarus
after initiation into the mysteries at Athens in the presence
of Augustus.</p>
<p>Lucian saw only one possible interpretation of Peregrinus&rsquo;
self-sacrifice, desire for notoriety, but there have
been many critics of this motivation as Harmon points
out:<a class="fn" id="fr_302" href="#fn_302">[302]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lucian believes himself to be exposing a sham, whose zeal was
not at all for truth but only for applause and renown. Many notable
modern critics, including Zeller, Bernays, Croiset, and Wilamowitz,
dissent from his interpretation, discerning in the man an
earnest seeker after truth; for to them thirst for glory is not an adequate
explanation of his final act.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece is written as a letter to Cronius who is marked
as a Platonist by the formula of greeting
<span title="eu prattein" class="g">&epsilon;&#8022; &pi;&rho;&#8049;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>.
Lucian begins with the fact of Peregrinus&rsquo; self-imposed death
and at once ascribes to him the motive of love of notoriety.
This, he says, is proved by the fact that Peregrinus selected
for the time of his suicide the Olympic festival, which
draws great crowds. Lucian knows that Cronius will
have a good laugh at the foolishness of the old man so he
will write his friend just what he himself saw as he stood
near the pyre.</p>
<p>His method is clever. First Theagenes a Cynic proclaimed
in the streets of Elis the glory of virtue and the
glory of her follower Proteus (Peregrinus) and announced
that Proteus was about to leave this life by fire in the manner
of Hercules, Aesculapius, Dionysus and Empedocles.
Theagenes&rsquo; justification of the deed went unheard because
of the noise of the crowd, but another orator (clearly Lucian)
stepped forth and made a speech reviewing Peregrinus&rsquo;
career. Beginning with Democritean laughter he
narrated the life of Proteus accusing him of adultery as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
youth in Armenia, of corrupting a boy in Asia, of strangling
his own father, of becoming a Christian in Palestine,
of resigning all his property in Parium on the Hellespont,
of practicing the ascetic life in Egypt, of seeking notoriety
in Greece by denouncing Herodes Atticus for his aqueduct
at Olympia and later recanting. Finally, says Lucian, this
Proteus has announced his intention of cremating himself.
The motive is love of fame though he claims that he wishes
thus to teach men to despise death and endure torture.
He plainly hopes that myths and a cult will arise around
his memory. Indeed Theagenes has quoted a prophecy
to that effect, but Lucian can match that oracle with another
which orders all the Cynic&rsquo;s disciples to imitate him
even to the last leap into the flames.</p>
<p>After these speeches, Lucian was on hand when the pyre
was kindled at Harpina near Olympia shortly after midnight.
As an eye-witness he saw the pyre in a pit six feet
deep, Peregrinus in the dress of a Cynic bearing a torch,
men lighting the fire, how then Peregrinus stripped to his
old shirt and after crying: &ldquo;Spirits of my mother and my
father, receive me with goodwill,&rdquo; leaped into the flames
to be seen no more. Even when the other Cynics stood
about the pyre in silent grief, Lucian felt no sympathy,
but taunted them brutally, and actually got into a broil
with them before he departed to meditate on how strange
the love of fame is. Lucian had to tell the story of Peregrinus&rsquo;
death over and over until to amuse himself, he
invented a vulture that he saw flying from the flames to
heaven, crying: &ldquo;I have left the earth, I am going to
Olympus.&rdquo; And this invention of his became part of the
growing myth about the hero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So ended (wrote Lucian) that poor wretch Proteus, a man who
(to put it briefly) never fixed his gaze on the verities, but always did
and said everything with a view to glory and the praise of the multitude,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
even to the extent of leaping into fire, when he was sure not
to enjoy the praise because he could not hear it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_303" href="#fn_303">[303]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucian concludes with anecdotes about Peregrinus sea-sick,
in a fever, having eye-trouble and trying to cure fever
and correct vision as though Aeacus in the lower world
would care about either ailment. He was simply furnishing
Democritus with more cause for laughter. This heartless
ridicule of the Cynic&rsquo;s action takes no account of the
psychology of fanaticism or the hysteria of martyrdom.
Croiset points out that Lucian&rsquo;s insensitivity to all mysticism
must be viewed with the knowledge that the satirist
believed Peregrinus was a sham and that he was unveiling
an impostor. Lucian&rsquo;s consistent worship of veracity and
frankness then explain his derisive attitude towards the
apotheosis of a pretender.<a class="fn" id="fr_304" href="#fn_304">[304]</a></p>
<p>The savagery used in exposing a false philosopher was
turned by Lucian upon a religious fraud, Alexander of
Abonoteichus. The piece is a letter to a friend, Celsus,
written after <span class="small">A.D.</span> 180, ten years after Alexander&rsquo;s death.
Lucian&rsquo;s account gives almost all we know of this Alexander
although his existence and influence are attested by
gems, coins and inscriptions. The letter, however, as
Croiset points out, contains more satire than history, for
it does not attempt to distinguish scrupulously between
the false and the true; rather it presents in lively anecdotes
and personal reminiscences a satiric portrait of an historical
prophet.<a class="fn" id="fr_305" href="#fn_305">[305]</a> Cumont has commented on the unique
features of Abonoteichus&rsquo; version of the worship of Aesculapius:
the giving a serpent a human head and calling
it the god incarnate; the issuing of oracles and advice instead
of using incubation or dealing particularly with
healing.<a class="fn" id="fr_306" href="#fn_306">[306]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Lucian exposes all Alexander&rsquo;s shams and corruptions.
He describes his handsome appearance and education, his
cleverness in purchasing a tame serpent and in selecting
the site of Abonoteichus for his oracle. He describes the
installation of the serpent, the invention of the human
head for it, the exhibition of it, the methods of giving
oracles, the prices, the publicity, the &ldquo;autophones,&rdquo; cunningly
contrived to issue from the serpent&rsquo;s mouth, the
spread of his fame even to Italy. Lucian pictures too the
perils that menaced any critics of the oracle, the burning
of the sayings of Epicurus, the personal danger to himself.
Lucian was advised by the governor of Bithynia and Pontus
not to prosecute Alexander for his attempted murder so
after the prophet&rsquo;s death he wrote this account to honor
Epicurus and to present the truth to thinking minds. Personal
revenge then as well as horror at religious fraud
motivated this biography. Lucian, who derided Epicureans
in <i>Philosophies for Sale</i>, chooses now to revere their
founder!</p>
<p>One of Lucian&rsquo;s greatest works bears the title <i>Parasites
for Pay</i>. It was written and undoubtedly read to the
public in the last part of his life before he went to Egypt.
It is not only very distinguished as a satire,<a class="fn" id="fr_307" href="#fn_307">[307]</a> but in it
as Gildersleeve points out<a class="fn" id="fr_308" href="#fn_308">[308]</a> &ldquo;his sensitiveness for Greek
honor, for the honor of the people as well as for the honor
of the literary class, manifests itself in a way to do infinite
credit to Lucian&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo; Harmon calls it &ldquo;a Hogarthian
sketch of the life led by educated Greeks who attached
themselves to the households of great Roman lords&mdash;and
ladies.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_309" href="#fn_309">[309]</a></p>
<p>The satire is in the form of a letter addressed to a friend
Timocles who is thinking of taking such a post. The case,
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
says Lucian, is the same for philosophers, grammarians,
rhetoricians, and musicians. The motives which apparently
led men to accept such positions are poverty and
pleasure, but their recompense is small and they have no
share in the luxury that dazzled them. They overwork;
their expenses in clothing and tips eat up their stipends.
Moreover their humiliations are incessant. The first
dinner given in their honor brings the strain of observing
proper etiquette. Next morning the conference about
salary disappoints all hopes by the pittance offered. But
a man sells himself and never afterwards can feel free or
noble: he is a monkey with a chain around his neck. For
he was not engaged to discourse on Homer, Demosthenes,
Plato, but because it looks well to have a distinguished
Greek philosopher with a long beard and a flowing robe
in his master&rsquo;s suite. The day&rsquo;s routine of service is exhausting
and humiliating, and the philosopher&rsquo;s rivals
for his lord&rsquo;s favor are a gigolo, a dancing master, an Alexandrian
dwarf who recites erotic verses. The night&rsquo;s sleep
is shattered by meditations on lost freedom and present
servitude.</p>
<p>Such is life in the city, but a trip to the country is worse.
Thermopolis had to hold his lady&rsquo;s puppy for her in the
jolting carriage and the miserable little dog kept licking
his beard for relics of yesterday&rsquo;s dinner and finally laid
a litter of puppies in the philosopher&rsquo;s cloak. Other services
of the parasite include listening to the rich man&rsquo;s
literary compositions and delivering a lecture on philosophy
to the lady while her hair is being dressed or at the
dinner-table. And in the midst of a discourse on virtue
a maid brings her a letter from a paramour which she
answers at once with a yes.</p>
<p>In time, envy and slander or the disabilities of old age
cause the parasite&rsquo;s downfall and he is discarded on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
rubbish heap. Such a career can best be depicted in a
symbolic painting of a hill on whose summit golden Wealth
resides. Hope, Deceit, Slavery help the traveller start on
the ascent. But Toil then escorts him on. And finally
Old Age, Insolence and Despair lead him until he is ejected
by a hidden back door, naked, deformed, ruined. Repentance
meeting him cannot save him. Timocles is urged
before making his decision about the post offered him to
meditate on this picture and on Plato&rsquo;s famous words:
&ldquo;God is not at fault; the fault is his who maketh the
choice.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_310" href="#fn_310">[310]</a> This essay alone would justify Croiset&rsquo;s great
tribute to Lucian&rsquo;s independence of thought: &ldquo;among
his contemporaries Lucian stands alone as an intelligence
of a remarkable force and independence which nothing
could tame.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_311" href="#fn_311">[311]</a></p>
<p>It was natural that, when later Lucian accepted a post
in civil service in Egypt, he should anticipate reminders
of his essay on <i>Parasites for Pay</i> on the part of his friends
and foes. His <i>Apology</i><a class="fn" id="fr_312" href="#fn_312">[312]</a> answers their imaginary criticisms
of his inconsistencies. It is written in the form of
a letter to a friend. Lucian assures this Sabinus that he
knows Sabinus enjoyed his recent essay on Parasites, but
now must be full of amazement at his friend&rsquo;s accepting
a salaried post in Egypt. He imagines receiving an epistle
from Sabinus to this effect:<a class="fn" id="fr_313" href="#fn_313">[313]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The difference between your precept and practice is infinitely
more ridiculous; you draw a realistic word-picture of that servile
life; you pour contempt on the man who runs into the trap of a
rich man&rsquo;s house, where a thousand degradations, half of them self-inflicted,
await him; and then in extreme old age, when you are
on the border between life and death, you take this miserable servitude
upon you and make a sort of circus exhibition of your chains.
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
The conspicuousness of your position will only make the more ridiculous
that contrast between your book and your life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucian in reply suggests various lines of self-defense:
the compulsion of Chance, Fate or Necessity; admiration
of his patron&rsquo;s character; the drive of poverty, brought on
by old age and ill health. But he rejects all these pleas.
His real defense is the difference between being a parasite
and slave in the house of a rich master and entering civil
service to work for the state. Lucian explains the dignity
and the responsibility of the post he has accepted in the
service of the Emperor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What better use can you make of yourself than if you join forces
with your friends in the cause of progress, come out into the open,
and let men see that you are loyal and zealous and careful of your
trust, not what Homer calls a vain cumberer of the earth?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_314" href="#fn_314">[314]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this brief review of the writings which make up
Lucian&rsquo;s literary autobiography shows the conflicting
forces which strove for dominance over his life. Sculpture
and the Education of a Sophist first contended for
his favor and his choice of the orator&rsquo;s training never destroyed
his life-long interest in art. Oratory which secured
his service soon disillusionized him because of her
cheap followers. Plato and his philosophical dialogues
for a while controlled his mind and style, but, satire proving
stronger in him than reflective thinking, he created a
new form of dialogue allied to Comedy and Menippus for
his medium of comment on the world. This form and the
epistle he used for satirizing sophistry and oratory, philosophy
and religion, always pointing out the counterfeit
and the sham and distinguishing them from the tested gold
of verities. This same sort of touch-stone he applied in
his <i>Apology</i> to his own life to vindicate his maintenance
of personal freedom. The traveller, the sophist, the satirist,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
now become civil servant of the Emperor, admits no
chain about his neck.</p>
<p>As regards his literary art he has revealed that his main
ideals are frankness, truth and freedom. In his works he
establishes warm human contacts with his hearer or reader.
His Greek style achieves a pure Attic simplicity of expression
and by it, as Croiset says,<a class="fn" id="fr_315" href="#fn_315">[315]</a> he clothes abstract ideas
in words which give them body and form. The main
qualities of his style, spirit and imagination, unite in the
effective descriptions and narrations which fill his works.
His wealth of ideas found expression in realistic details
noted with keen observation and assembled in realistic
series to give vitality to his prose.</p>
<p>One work by Lucian is a specific treatise on writing and
peculiarly significant for his literary autobiography. That
is the essay on <i>How History Should Be Written</i>. It was
composed as a letter to a friend Philo in the time of Marcus
Aurelius and Lucius Verus. The occasion was the sudden
spawning of a whole shoal of would-be historians after
the Roman victories in the war with the Parthians (<span class="small">A.D.</span>
165). Outraged by these scribblers, Lucian sets forth his
thoughts on the True Historian.</p>
<p>Since the barbarian war began, says Lucian, everyone is
writing history. It is just as when an epidemic of madness
at Abdera made all the people chant tragedies. It recalls
too Diogenes, who, when Corinth was in danger of a siege
from Philip and the citizens were hurrying defense measures,
kept rolling his jar up and down hill that he might
seem as busy as the rest of the world. Lucian&rsquo;s advice
will include the faults of historians which are to be avoided,
the virtues to be cultivated.</p>
<p>History must not be written as panegyric. History
must not be written as poetry. Among the faults of contemporary
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
historians are lack of taste, over-abundance of
details, purple patches, inaccuracies about facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are some ... who leave alone, or deal very cursorily
with, all that is great and memorable; amateurs and not artists,
they have no selective faculty, and loiter over copious laboured
descriptions of the various trifles; it is as if a visitor to Olympia,
instead of examining, commending or describing to his stay-at-home
friends the general greatness and beauty of the Zeus, were to
be struck with the exact symmetry and polish of its footstool, or the
proportions of its shoe, and give all his attention to these minor
points.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_316" href="#fn_316">[316]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indispensable qualities of the ideal historian are political
insight and ability in writing. His &ldquo;one task is to tell
the thing as it happened.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_317" href="#fn_317">[317]</a> He will be &ldquo;fearless, incorruptible,
independent, a believer in frankness and veracity;
one that will call a spade a spade, make no concession
to likes and dislikes, nor spare any men for pity or respect
or propriety; an impartial judge, kind to all, but too kind
to none; a literary cosmopolite with neither suzerain nor
king, never heeding what this or that man may think, but
setting down the thing that befell.&rdquo;<a class="fn" href="#fn_317">[317]</a> Thucydides fulfills
this ideal.</p>
<p>In diction and style, the marks of the true historian are
frankness and truth, lucidity and simplicity. The preface
should be in proportion to the subject. &ldquo;The body of
the history ... is nothing from beginning to end but a
long narrative; it must therefore be graced with the narrative
virtues&mdash;smooth, level, and consistent progress,
neither soaring nor crawling, and the charm of lucidity.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Brevity is always desirable.&rdquo; &ldquo;Restraint in descriptions
of mountains, walls, rivers, and the like, is very important.&rdquo;
If a speech is introduced, &ldquo;the first requirement is that it
should suit the character both of the speaker and of the
occasion.&rdquo; &ldquo;It may occasionally happen that some extraordinary
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
story has to be introduced; it should be simply
narrated, without guarantee of its truth, thrown down for
any-one to make what he can of it.&rdquo; The historian should
write not for the present, but for eternity. He should
hope to have said of himself: &ldquo;This was a man indeed,
free and free-spoken; flattery and servility were not in
him; he was truth all through.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_318" href="#fn_318">[318]</a></p>
<p>Gildersleeve was probably right in calling the <i>True History</i>
&ldquo;a comic sequel to a brilliant essay entitled &lsquo;How to
write History.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_319" href="#fn_319">[319]</a> The traditional manuscript order
which places the <i>True History</i> after <i>How History Should
Be Written</i> seems so aptly prompted by Lucianic irony.
For this romance in two books is not history at all and has
nothing of Lucian&rsquo;s primary requirement for history, that
it should be true! It is a work of pure imagination, one
of the earliest accounts of fictitious voyages and as such is
part of the great tradition from the Odyssey to <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s
Travels</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_320" href="#fn_320">[320]</a> Lucian&rsquo;s preface explains both the nature of
the piece and his reasons for writing it.<a class="fn" id="fr_321" href="#fn_321">[321]</a></p>
<p>The <i>True History</i> like many good stories is told in the
first person by Lucian himself. The author, moreover,
preludes and interrupts the narrative to get in direct touch
with his reader. In his introduction, he states that his
purpose in writing is to furnish to students some reading
that will give relaxation, but at the same time &ldquo;a little
food for thought.&rdquo; The story is bound to charm, Lucian
thinks, because of the novelty of the subject, the humor of
the plan, the plausible lying involved and the comical
parodies of such authors as Ctesias, Iambulus, and Homer
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
in his Odyssey. Lucian confesses to being a liar with the
best of them, but affirms that his lying is unique in being
honest because he admits it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be it understood, then, that I am writing about things which
I have neither seen nor had to do with nor learned from others&mdash;which,
in fact, do not exist at all and, in the nature of things,
cannot exist. Therefore my readers should on no account believe
in them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_322" href="#fn_322">[322]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of this confession, Lucian here and there in his
story tries to create an atmosphere of veracity by protestations
of it. As he never saw the Corn Sparrow forces or
the Crane Knights, he does not venture to relate the marvellous
and incredible stories told about them.<a class="fn" id="fr_323" href="#fn_323">[323]</a> When
he describes the magic mirror over a well in the Moon
which furnished him television of his family and country
he says that disbelievers by going there will find he tells
the truth.<a class="fn" id="fr_324" href="#fn_324">[324]</a> In the Island of the Wicked, Lucian finds
all liars, both those who had told lies on earth or written
them, among the latter Ctesias and Herodotus. &ldquo;On seeing
them,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I had good hopes for the future, for
I have never told a lie that I know of.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_325" href="#fn_325">[325]</a> The last sentence
of the romance is: &ldquo;What happened in the other
world I shall tell you in the succeeding books.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_326" href="#fn_326">[326]</a> This,
a Greek scholiast comments, is the greatest lie of all!</p>
<p>Now after having seen what a wag Lucian is from his
own words, we must decide how we are going to take him.
Are we to seek in him relaxation and entertainment (the
gift of all true romance) or are we going to marshal our
&ldquo;little learning&rdquo; to meet his and study all his sources, his
parodies of historians and philosophers, or search for allegories
in his fantastic worlds? The happy way will be
along the path of the golden mean. Gildersleeve put up a
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
sign-board to it and inscribed directions for future travellers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To enjoy the show properly, it is far better for the reader to give
himself up to this play of Lucian&rsquo;s fancy than to endeavor to unriddle
whatever satire of contemporary literature may lie concealed
in its allegory.... There may be profound meaning in the war
which breaks out between the Sunburghers under Pha&ecirc;thon, and
the Moonburghers under Endymion, which begins with the attempt
of the Moonburghers to found a colony on the desert planet
of Lucifer, and which ends with the victory of the Sunburghers,
Lucifer being declared common property and the vanquished compelled
to pay an annual tribute of ten thousand <i>amphoreis</i> of dew.
But so elastic are all such allegories that they can be stretched to fit
anything, and the war of these Heliotes and Selenites would answer
to describe the conflict between orthodoxy and rationalism, and
Lucifer would stand for the coming man. But how much better to
look with childish interest on the marshalling of Horsevultures and
Chickpeashooters and Garlickfighters and Flea-archers and Wind-runners,
and to watch the huge spiders spin their web from the
moon to Lucifer.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_327" href="#fn_327">[327]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after realizing that we too may visit the Isles of the
Blessed and the Wicked, may soar up to Aristophanes&rsquo;
Cloudcuckooland or dive under the sea in the brother of
Jonah&rsquo;s whale, or see Sinbad&rsquo;s roc, let us begin at the beginning.
Let the lights go out and the curtain go up.
Let us watch breathlessly an ancient Walt Disney fantasy
rush across the screen. The very names of countries and
peoples add to the excitement as the panorama unrolls.
And so vivid are Lucian&rsquo;s descriptions that as in all good
movies soon we find ourselves participating in his adventures.
Having set out from the Pillars of Hercules with
fifty men on a good ship, on the eightieth day we come to a
wooded island. Here huge footprints and an inscription
reveal that Hercules and Dionysus were here before us.
And no wonder, for this is the Isle of Wines: grape-vines
produce springs of wine, springs feed rivers, rivers produce
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
fish that eaten make people drunk. And there is a species
of vine that is half grape and half lady like Daphne turning
into a laurel and the kiss of the Vine-woman brings
intoxication and her embrace is a prison. We lost two
of our men to that captivity.</p>
<p>As we set sail, a whirlwind lifted the ship and she became
a hydroplane, sailing through the air for seven days
and seven nights. The island where then we landed
proved to be the Moon. Endymion is the King so of
course he spoke Greek and we at once joined his forces
for he had a war on with the Men of the Sun, whose King
is Phaethon. It was all about which should colonize the
Morning Star. Our fellow Moonites were as strange as
their names: Vulture Knights, Grass Plumes, Pea Shooters,
Garlic Warriors, Flea Bowmen, Wind Aviators, Corn
Sparrows and Crane Knights. And Phaethon&rsquo;s Heliotes
were as fantastic: Ant Knights, Mosquito Aviators, Dance
Aviators, Stalk Mushrooms, Dog-faced Knights, Cloud
Centaurs. A fierce battle we had and the Men of the
Sun won because they cut off light from the Moon so
Endymion surrendered. We saw strange marvels in our
stay on the Moon: how men are the child-bearers; how
their clothing is made of glass or bronze; their eyes are
removable; they have a mirror over a well in which they
can see what happens in far distant lands.</p>
<p>As we voyaged onward, we came to many other countries:
to the Morning Star which was just being colonized,
to Lamp Town where among the inhabitants Lucian found
his own Lamp which gave him news of home, to Cloudcuckooland
which Aristophanes described so truthfully.
But after such interesting scenes, disaster fell upon us. A
monstrous whale bore down upon us and in a trice swallowed
us, ship and all.</p>
<p>When we recovered from our terror, we found that life
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
inside a whale is confined but not impossible. We discovered
an island where we beached our boat. The whale
opened his mouth once an hour so we could mark time
and get the points of the compass. And we soon met other
men there, a Cypriote called Scintharus and his son.
Scintharus told us about the other inhabitants of the
whale, who were savage barbarians, and always ready to
attack them. We thought best to join Scintharus in subduing
these enemies, but the fight was fierce for there
were scores of these Lobsters, Crabhands, Tunnyheads,
Seagoats, Crawfish Coots and Solefish. After our victory,
we lived fairly well in the whale for a year and eight
months. In the ninth month, we saw through the teeth
of our monster the most terrifying battle, a sea-fight between
men riding on huge islands each of which carried
about one hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>In spite of seeing such dangers outside, we decided
finally that we must escape from our prison. We used
fire as a weapon, set the forest at the tail-end aflame and
after twelve days found that the whale was going to die.
Just in time we propped open his mouth with huge beams
and the next day when he expired, out we went on our
good ship and felt once more the wind in our sails. Fair
weather did not last long. A terrible northern gale descended
and froze all the sea to a depth of six fathoms.
Scintharus, who was now our ship-master, saved us by
directing us to excavate a cave-home in the ice. In it we
lived for thirty days, building a fire and cooking the fish
we cut out of the ice. When food gave out, we dug out
the boat and sailed over the ice as though it were the sea
until on the fifth day we came to open water. Now we
kept coming to various islands. We got water at one
and at the next one milk, for this island had grapes whose
juice was milk, and its earth was cheese. It was easy to
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
subsist there! Next we passed the Isle of Cork where the
city is built on a cork foundation and the men have feet
of cork so that they can run over the waters as they will,
buoyed up by their own life-preservers!</p>
<p>Happiest of all our stays was that on the Island of the
Blessed. Here it is always spring. Every month the vines
yield grapes and the trees fruit. It is a land flowing with
milk and wine. Glass trees furnish goblets which fill
automatically at the banquet. Baked loaves of bread are
plucked from trees. Beside the table are two springs,
one of laughter, one of joy, and with draughts from these
the banqueters start their revels. Famous men dwell
there. I saw Socrates surrounded by fair young men arguing
with Nestor and Palamedes. Plato preferred to live
in his own Republic. The followers of Aristippus and
Epicurus were considered the best of companions, but
Diogenes the Cynic had reformed, married Lais and taken
to dancing. The Stoics had not yet arrived for they were
still toiling up the steep hill of virtue. Conversation with
Homer was one of the greatest pleasures, especially as he
settled the matter of his birthplace by declaring himself
a Babylonian and solved the Homeric question by affirming
that he had written all the lines attributed to him.
Beside literary talks, there were games for the Dead.</p>
<p>Even the Island of the Blessed could not be free from
wars, for the Wicked invaded it and had to be expelled by
force. Homer wrote a new epic on the fight of the dead
heroes. The Island had its scandals too all due again to
Helen. For she bewitched Scintharus&rsquo; son and tried to
elope with him, but was caught. That episode caused our
expulsion from the Island of the Blessed. Before we left,
Homer wrote a couplet for Lucian which he had carved on
a stele of beryl and Odysseus secretly gave him a letter
for Calypso.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>We touched at the Isle of the Wicked and at the Isle of
Dreams, where we slept thirty days and next we put in at
Ogygia. Lucian read Odysseus&rsquo; letter before he delivered
it to Calypso and found he had always regretted leaving
her! For Odysseus&rsquo; sake, Calypso entertained us royally.</p>
<p>Next we fell into danger from the Pumpkin Pirates and
the Hardshell Pirates and the Dolphin-Riders, but we
escaped them all. One night we ran aground on the marvellous
and mighty nest of a king-fisher. And a little
further on in the sea we came to a forest of rootless trees
which we could not penetrate. There was nothing to do
but haul the ship up to their tops and take &ldquo;a forest cruise&rdquo;
across. More marvellous still we had to cross a water-chasm
on a water bridge, a river-way between two water
precipices. After that we came to the Isle of the Bellowing
Bullheads, men like Minotaurs, and had some skirmishes
with them. And then we came to an Island of
Fair Ladies who wished to take us to bed with them, but
Lucian discovered that they all had ass-legs and that they
ate strangers when they had cozened them to sleep. So
we departed in haste. At dawn we saw the land which is
on the other side of the world from ours and there we were
shipwrecked. What happened there will be another
story.</p>
<p>This review of the two books of Lucian&rsquo;s <i>True History</i>
reveals at once its startling differences from the other Greek
romances of the early Empire. Romantic love does not
figure in it. Religion has little or no place in it. Adventures
are its bones and sinews. These adventures
though described realistically are all figments of the imagination,
explorations of the Wonderful Things beyond
Thule as much as those of Antonius Diogenes must have
been. The coloring of the pictures is an amazing mixture
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
of realism and fantasy. The veracity of sense impressions
almost converts doubting Thomases. Lucian comes to
seem no mean rival of Herodotus, the Father of Lies. Only
occasionally some satiric laughter betrays him.</p>
<p>It is perhaps easier for twentieth century readers to accept
his wonders than it was for his contemporaries of
the second century. Science has developed so many
of his imaginative forecasts. The monstrous footprints of
Hercules and Dionysus might be rock-prints of dinosaurs.
The plunging whale is a submarine. His ship lifting from
the ocean to sail through the air has become the hydroplane.
His island galleys bearing one hundred and twenty
men each are our battleships. The Cloud Centaurs who
fight in the air are our aviators. Arctic explorers have
lived in huts made of ice-blocks. Ice-sailing is a recognized
winter sport. Clothing is made not of glass or
bronze, but of cellulose and steel. Removable eyes suggest
spectacles, contact lenses and field-glasses. The Cork-footed
Men must have resembled surf riders. And the
magic mirror over the well anticipated the perforated
sphere of television.</p>
<p>But his contemporaries had the advantage of us in recognizing
Lucian&rsquo;s sources and parodies more readily than we
can. For us, Antonius Diogenes, Ctesias and Iambulus
are lost. Yet Photius records that the romance of Antonius
Diogenes, <i>The Wonders beyond Thule</i>, was the
chief source of Lucian&rsquo;s <i>True History</i>. So many, however,
are the sources which Lucian used to forward his
avowed purpose of furnishing relaxation accompanied by
some learning, that scholars have busied themselves for
years tracing parallels with Greek and Latin authors.<a class="fn" id="fr_328" href="#fn_328">[328]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
Allinson remarks wisely: &ldquo;In general, it seems safe to conclude
that Lucian regarded the writings of predecessors
and contemporaries as an open quarry from which he first
built up his own style and then picked out material to
imbed, with an artist&rsquo;s skill, in the parti-coloured mosaic
of his satire.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_329" href="#fn_329">[329]</a></p>
<p>Some idea of Lucian&rsquo;s parody of his sources may be
gained, even though Antonius Diogenes is lost, from his
incidental flings at great Greeks and from his constant
references to Homer which are a mixture of admiration
and irony. So when he saw Cloudcuckooland he remembered
Aristophanes the poet, &ldquo;a wise and truthful
man whose writings are distrusted without reason.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_330" href="#fn_330">[330]</a>
On the Island of the Blessed he did not find Plato for he
preferred to live in the city of his imagination under his
own constitution and laws. Yet he might well have been
in Elysium for the inhabitants are most Platonic in sharing
their wives.<a class="fn" id="fr_331" href="#fn_331">[331]</a> The solemn treaty which ended the wars
between the Men of the Sun and the Men of the Moon has
a comical resemblance to the treaty between Athens and
Sparta which Thucydides records though it is signed by
Fireman, Hotman, and Burner, by Nightman, Moonman
and Allbright.<a class="fn" id="fr_332" href="#fn_332">[332]</a></p>
<p>Herodotus comes in for more imitation, for he furnishes
stories of ants bigger than foxes,<a class="fn" id="fr_333" href="#fn_333">[333]</a> of dog-headed men,<a class="fn" id="fr_334" href="#fn_334">[334]</a>
of men who feed on odors,<a class="fn" id="fr_335" href="#fn_335">[335]</a> of a feast of lanterns in Egypt,<a class="fn" id="fr_336" href="#fn_336">[336]</a>
of a floating island,<a class="fn" id="fr_337" href="#fn_337">[337]</a> of the sea freezing,<a class="fn" id="fr_338" href="#fn_338">[338]</a> of a breeze that
bears the perfume of Arabia.<a class="fn" id="fr_339" href="#fn_339">[339]</a> But when Lucian solemnly
imitates these exaggerations, we feel he has his
tongue in his cheek and our suspicion is confirmed when
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
he consigns Ctesias and Herodotus to the limbo of Liars
in the Island of the Wicked.<a class="fn" id="fr_340" href="#fn_340">[340]</a></p>
<p>Lucian&rsquo;s treatment of Homer shows his most genial
irony. In his preface he makes Homer&rsquo;s Odysseus the
guide and teacher of all historians of imaginary travels,
Odysseus &ldquo;who tells Alcinous and his court about winds
in bondage, one-eyed men, cannibals and savages; also
about animals with many heads, and transformations of
his comrades wrought with drugs,&rdquo; and with such marvels
&ldquo;humbugged the illiterate Phaeacians.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_341" href="#fn_341">[341]</a> But in the
Island of the Blessed, Homer is the shade in whose talk
Lucian most delights. Homer indeed is most affable in
discussing all the literary problems of his epics, especially
since he had just won a lawsuit in which Thersites accused
him of libel, through the aid of his lawyer Odysseus.<a class="fn" id="fr_342" href="#fn_342">[342]</a>
Homer as a shade is still writing for when there was war
in heaven, he produced a new epic about the battle of the
shades of the heroes,<a class="fn" id="fr_343" href="#fn_343">[343]</a> which Lucian unfortunately lost
on the way home, and on Lucian&rsquo;s departure Homer composed
a commemorative epigram which described him as
dear to the blessed gods.<a class="fn" id="fr_344" href="#fn_344">[344]</a></p>
<p>Lucian introduces Homer&rsquo;s characters into his scenes.
Achilles is one of the most honored heroes on the Island
of the Blessed, serving as joint judge with Theseus at the
Games of the Dead.<a class="fn" id="fr_345" href="#fn_345">[345]</a> Helen is the leading lady in the
court-room scene where Rhadamanthus had to decide
whose wife she should be in Elysium. She has forgiven
Stesichorus for saying she caused the Trojan War.<a class="fn" id="fr_346" href="#fn_346">[346]</a> But
she creates a new scandal by trying to desert Menelaus
again in an elopement with Scintharus&rsquo; son.<a class="fn" id="fr_347" href="#fn_347">[347]</a> Calypso
on receiving Odysseus&rsquo; letter from Lucian&rsquo;s hand weeps
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
as she reads that he always regretted giving up his life with
her, and then with true feminine curiosity asks how Penelope
is looking now and whether she is as wise as Odysseus
used to boast. Lucian made such replies as he thought
would gratify her!<a class="fn" id="fr_348" href="#fn_348">[348]</a></p>
<p>Minor episodes are reminiscent of the Odyssey. Rhadamanthus
gives Lucian a talisman of mallow as Hermes
gave Odysseus the moly.<a class="fn" id="fr_349" href="#fn_349">[349]</a> To the Land of Dreams Lucian
must erect four gates in place of Homer&rsquo;s two, one
of horn, one of ivory.<a class="fn" id="fr_350" href="#fn_350">[350]</a> And the Singing Sirens that tried
to beguile Odysseus have been metamorphosed into fair
young ladies in long chitons which conceal the legs of she-asses.<a class="fn" id="fr_351" href="#fn_351">[351]</a>
But whatever changes are made in the source-material
taken from the Odyssey, Lucian&rsquo;s gentle raillery
does not hide his admiration of great Homer. He gives
the lie to the myth that Homer was blind.<a class="fn" id="fr_352" href="#fn_352">[352]</a> And in the
contest of the poets at the Games of the Dead in the Island
of the Blessed, he ironically makes Hesiod the victor
though he affirms that in truth Homer was by far the best
of poets.</p>
<p>Lucian&rsquo;s style in his <i>True History</i> illustrates many of
his own criteria for writing history. The short preface
is in proportion to the short two-book <i>True History</i>. The
narrative is concise, rapid, lucid and shows consistent progress,
one event following naturally and quickly upon
another without extravagant use of details. The few
speeches are short, lively and suited to the character of the
speaker. The descriptions are realistic and pointed. Extraordinary
stories are told simply with an appearance of
veracity.</p>
<p>A few typical elements of the Greek Romances appear in
the <i>True History</i>. There is a suggestion of a court-room
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
scene where Rhadamanthus judges Helen&rsquo;s accomplices in
escape. One letter is inserted, Odysseus&rsquo; to Calypso, for
the purpose of ironic satire of Homeric characters. An
inscription on bronze is discovered and a laudatory couplet
in hexameter is composed and inscribed on stone. But
love and religion, the commonest themes of the Greek Romances,
are eliminated from this tale of marvellous adventures.</p>
<p>Satire though this story is, it ranks easily first among
imaginary voyagings both in fantasy and style. In his
narration Lucian pours all his spirit, his liveliness of observation,
his brilliant imagination, his vivacious wit. His
own enjoyment in his facile, marvellous inventions is contagious.
As he rushes his breathless readers over the earth,
through the air, under the sea, as he introduces us to innumerable
natural phenomena and monstrous beings, he
convinces us that this world of fantasy is a real world. He
has made many others wish to record similar travels, for
the <i>True History</i> is the model of all those imaginary voyages
with which Rabelais, Cyrano de Bergerac, Swift, Voltaire
and others amused their contemporaries. No work
of Lucian found so many imitators as this.<a class="fn" id="fr_353" href="#fn_353">[353]</a></p>
<p>The readers of Lucian&rsquo;s <i>True History</i> on finishing it
feel that they have drunk with him more from his eternal
springs of joy and laughter than from his irony, in fact that
his irony gives only a few drops of angostura bitters to the
heady cocktails of his wit. And at the end the readers of
this romance are ready today to salute the shade of Lucian
as Andrew Lang did:<a class="fn" id="fr_354" href="#fn_354">[354]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In what bower, oh Lucian, of your rediscovered Islands Fortunate
are you now reclining; the delight of the fair, the learned, the
witty, and the brave?...</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;There, among the vines that bear twelve times in the year, more
excellent than all the vineyards of Touraine, while the song-birds
bring you flowers from vales enchanted, and the shapes of the
Blessed come and go, beautiful in wind-woven raiment of sunset
hues; there, in a land that knows not age, nor winter, midnight,
nor autumn, nor noon, where the silver twilight of summer-dawn
is perennial, where youth does not wax spectre-pale and die; there,
my Lucian, you are crowned the Prince of the Paradise of Mirth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may seem anti-climax to turn from the <i>True History</i>
to Lucian&rsquo;s other romance, the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, for the
second exists only in an epitome by another hand. Since
however this epitome is included in all the best manuscripts
and has been proved conclusively by B. E. Perry to
be a condensation of an original <i>Metamorphoses</i> by Lucian
on the basis of spirit, vocabulary, syntax and phraseology,
we must try to form some idea of this other romance.<a class="fn" id="fr_355" href="#fn_355">[355]</a></p>
<p>As the <i>True History</i> is a satire of travellers&rsquo; tales, this
epitome, <i>Lucius or Ass</i>, is primarily a satire of magic and
magic rites. Just as in the <i>True History</i> not only epic
poets and historians were parodied, but philosophers came
in for their share of ironic comment, so in <i>Lucius or Ass</i>
satire is directed not merely against magicians, but also
against corrupt priests and frail women. The satire is of
the earth, earthy, very near the folk-story from which it
may have originated. <i>Lucius or Ass</i> is Everyman in his
credulity, gullibility and bestiality. The only heroines in
his murky world are a witch-woman and a corrupt maid.
This epitome has two great values: it gives us some idea
of Lucian&rsquo;s lost <i>Metamorphoses</i>, and hence affords a basis
for comparison with Apuleius&rsquo; great Latin novel <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
It will prove convenient I hope, to have a rather
full outline presented here in English for purposes of discussion
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
and comparison. This Greek <i>Lucius or Ass</i> like
the <i>True History</i> is written in the first person, but Lucius
of Patrae, the hero, not the author, is the narrator. In my
brief r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I have found it clearer to write Lucius&rsquo; account
in the third person.</p>
<p>Once upon a time on a journey to Thessaly Lucius inquires
of some fellow travellers whereabouts in the city of
Hypata a man named Hipparchus lives, for he is carrying
a letter of introduction to him. On his arrival he stays at
Hipparchus&rsquo; house. Only his wife and a maid Palaestra
lived with him. On his host&rsquo;s inquiring the object of his
travels, Lucius says he is on his way to Larissa. He conceals
the fact that he is searching for women who deal in magic.
While walking around the city, he meets an old friend of
his mother named Abroea, who warns him against the wife
of Hipparchus because she is a witch. Lucius, delighted
with this news, returns to Hipparchus&rsquo; house and in the
absence of his host and hostess makes love to Palaestra with
the purpose of persuading the maid to acquaint him with
her mistress&rsquo; magic powers. At the close of a night of
revel, Lucius persuades Palaestra to show him her mistress
at her magic rites.</p>
<p>A few nights later Palaestra fulfills her promise by leading
Lucius at dead of night to the door of her lady&rsquo;s bedroom
where through a crack he can watch her proceedings.
She mutters to her lamp. She strips. She rubs her naked
body with ointment from a little box. Gradually she is
transformed into an owl and flies away to her lover. Lucius
then prevails upon Palaestra to let him attempt the
same transformation. By ill luck the maid brings him
the wrong box of ointment so that he is changed not into
a bird, but into an ass. Palaestra soothingly assures him
that the antidote is simple, just a meal of roses, and if her
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
dearest will pass the night quietly in the stable, in the
morning she will gather the flowers and recover her Lucius.</p>
<p>But this simple plan gangs a-gley, for in the night robbers
raid the house, secure much booty and to carry it steal
also the horse and the real ass of Hipparchus and Lucius.
So the man-ass, heavily burdened, is driven to the robbers&rsquo;
home. One old woman is their care-taker. Several days
later the robbers return from one of their forays bringing
in as booty a young woman whom they have kidnapped.
Later on in the absence of the brigands the girl tries to
escape riding on the ass, but both are captured by the
robbers. On their return, they find that the old woman
in terror has hanged herself.</p>
<p>The robbers plan a dreadful punishment for the culprits:
to kill the ass, disembowel him and sew the girl up
alive in his paunch to die by slow torture. But before
they achieve this horror, a company of soldiers arrives,
captures the whole band and carries them off to a magistrate.
They had been conducted to the robbers&rsquo; den by
the fianc&eacute; of the girl. He now escorts her home on the
honored ass Lucius.</p>
<p>After the wedding of the happy pair, the bride persuades
her father to reward the ass her benefactor so he is
to be turned out into pasture with the she-asses. But the
servant to whom the care of the ass is intrusted wickedly
takes him home and makes him labor first in a mill, then
carrying fagots on a steep mountain, where a cruel driver
mistreats him. In the midst of his sufferings, news comes
that the bride and groom have been drowned on the seashore.
So since their new masters are dead, the servants
all flee, taking the ass with them. They sell him in a city
of Macedonia to a eunuch priest of a Syrian goddess. In
his life with the priests, Lucius is so horrified by their impure
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
practices that he brays loudly in protest. The noise
brings up some passing peasants who go off to tell the
village the obscenities they have witnessed. The priests
have to flee for their lives, but first they nearly kill the ass
by beating him for his braying.</p>
<p>Lucius is in danger of his life again at the house of a rich
man where they stop. For the servants who have lost the
meat of a wild ass which was to be the dinner (the dogs
stole it), plot to kill Lucius and serve up his flesh. He
saves himself only by running away from the cook. The
priests are now arrested because they are found in possession
of a golden phiale which they stole from a temple,
and the ass is sold to a baker. In the mill Lucius is so
worn down by the hard work that he is sold as worthless to
an old gardener. On the way to town, this gardener has
a quarrel with a soldier and nearly kills him so the gardener
and the ass have to go into hiding. Stupid Lucius
betrays their hiding place by putting his head out of an
upper window to see what is going on. Captured he is
given to the soldier, but he soon sells him to a cook. Now
Lucius fattens on good food by surreptitious filching of
choice portions which the cook and his brother had reserved
for themselves. By a little detective work the
brothers discover that the thief is the ass. They show him
eating men&rsquo;s food to their master, who promptly buys the
ass, has a servant train him to act like a man (easy lessons
for Lucius!) and exhibits him for admission fees. A
woman buys a night with him and has intercourse with
him.</p>
<p>Then his master purposes to exhibit him couched with
a woman (a condemned criminal) at a public festival.
The scene is all set when some one comes up to Lucius and
the woman at the banquet table bearing, among other
flowers, roses. At last the ass has his meal of restorative
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
flowers and becomes once more Lucius. He appeals to
the magistrate for protection against those who cry he is
a magician and must be killed. He informs the governor
that his name is Lucius, he has a brother Gaius, both have
the same two other names; that he himself is a writer of
stories and his brother is an elegiac poet and a good
prophet. The magistrate believing his story gives him
hospitality. Lucius&rsquo; brother comes to take him home,
but first Lucius thought it fitting to call on the woman
who had given him her love when he was an ass. He is
chagrined to find that as a man he has no charm for her!
He sails with his brother to Patrae and there sacrifices to
the gods who have saved him.</p>
<p>No other work attributed to Lucian has aroused greater
controversy than <i>Lucius or Ass</i>. All the literature about
it is reviewed in Ben Edwin Perry&rsquo;s epoch-making book
<i>The Metamorphoses Ascribed to Lucius of Patrae</i>, which
conclusively proves that <i>Lucius or Ass</i> is an epitome of
Lucian&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, made by another writer. Perry
analyzes Photius&rsquo; description of the lost Greek <i>Metamorphoses</i>
with its theory of the three versions of the ass-story,<a class="fn" id="fr_356" href="#fn_356">[356]</a>
and proves that Photius&rsquo; one mistake was in thinking
that the name Lucius of Patrae referred to an author of
a third <i>Metamorphoses</i>, which was probably the original
of Lucian&rsquo;s and Apuleius&rsquo; stories: Lucius of Patrae in
<i>Lucius or Ass</i> is the hero-narrator, not the author. Perry
then with convincing logic reconstructs the probable content
of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of which <i>Lucius or Ass</i> is an
epitome and with the same irrefutable reasoning discusses
the nature of this original Greek novel. The basis of it
was a folk-lore story of a transformation. The style was
plain, the narrative rapid, the tone ironic. The narrator
keeps the character of the hero of the adventures and never
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
identifies himself with the author. The character of the
hero is that of &ldquo;an unique clown&rdquo; with an absorbing and
credulous interest in strange phenomena especially transformations.
The final proof that the <i>Metamorphoses</i> was
satirical is &ldquo;the simple fact that the <i>Eselmensch</i> is a litterateur
and an investigator of marvels.&rdquo; &ldquo;The generic
title shows that the author regarded his story as a kind of
commentary on the subject of metamorphoses, and writers
who interested themselves in such things.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_357" href="#fn_357">[357]</a></p>
<p>This author, &ldquo;second century Atticist, humorist, and
satirist,&rdquo; can be none other than Lucian himself, for the
Greek <i>Metamorphoses</i> is Lucianic in type, is a relaxation
from serious work as is the <i>True History</i>; it shows the
same satire of credulity that other works of Lucian (for example
the <i>Alexander</i>) did; and it is colored by the same
ironic humor. The epitome contains a striking Lucianic
element although this is overlaid by philological errors.
Perry also analyzes resemblances and differences between
the reconstructed <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Lucian and Apuleius&rsquo;
novel, but this discussion I shall reserve for the next chapter.</p>
<p><i>Lucius or Ass</i> is valuable in proving that Lucian wrote
not one but two romances; that in both he developed
a new type of romance, the satiric; that in each he maintained
the same great qualities which mark his other
writings: the quest for truth, intolerance of fraud and
credulity; keen observation and realistic description;
condensation, rapidity, clarity; dramatic irony. The two
romances also show more than any other of Lucian&rsquo;s writings
his brilliant imaginative powers.</p>
<p>A postscript to this discussion of Lucian&rsquo;s satiric romances
may well include an account of a novel in miniature
which appears in one of his dialogues. Writing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
the second century he was of course thoroughly familiar
with the conventional type of the Greek romance.
Though this statement might be accepted <i>a priori</i>, certain
evidence of it is furnished by his insertion in his <i>Toxaris</i>
of an epitome of a Scythian romance of love and adventure.
The <i>Toxaris</i> is a Platonic dialogue written probably about
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 165, in Lucian&rsquo;s period of transition from purely
rhetorical writings to those of moral or religious satire.<a class="fn" id="fr_358" href="#fn_358">[358]</a>
In it a Greek Mnesippus and a Scythian Toxaris discuss
friendship each giving five illustrations of famous instances
in his own country. The longest one related is a
Scythian romance told by Toxaris.<a class="fn" id="fr_359" href="#fn_359">[359]</a> Rostovtzeff has
shown that Lucian probably had in his hands a Greek
romance with a Scythian background, for papyri fragments
furnish incontrovertible evidence of a similar Scythian
romance in Greek dating from the second century
<span class="small">A.D.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_360" href="#fn_360">[360]</a></p>
<p>The story as told by Lucian is melodramatic. It relates
the devotion of three Scythians, Macentes, Lonchates and
Arsacomas, who had pledged to each other friendship for
life and death in the old Scythian way of shedding some of
their blood into a cup and quaffing it together. Now
Arsacomas, who had gone on a mission to Leucanor, king
of Bosporus, there fell madly in love at first sight with his
daughter Mazaea. At a banquet when suitors were bidding
for the hand of the princess with proud lists of their
possessions, all Arsacomas could boast of was his two fair,
brave friends. The Bosporans laughed him to scorn and
the girl was awarded to Adyrmachus, who the next day
was to convey his bride to the land of the Machlyans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>The outraged Arsacomas rushing home told his friends
how he and their friendship had been ridiculed and the
three as one man planned immediate vengeance. Lonchates
promised to bring Arsacomas the head of Leucanor.
Macentes was to kidnap the bride. Arsacomas was to stay
at home and raise an army on the ox-hide for the war that
would surely follow. All proceeded according to schedule.
Arsacomas slew an ox, cut up and cooked the meat,
spread the hide on the ground and sat on it with his hands
held behind him. This is the greatest appeal for aid possible
for a man who desires to secure help for vengeance.
His friends and kinsmen coming accepted each a portion
of the meat, set right foot on the hide and pledged as much
aid as he could. So a goodly army was raised.</p>
<p>Lonchates went to Bosporus, pretending he had come as
a friend to offer aid against Arsacomas&rsquo; planned invasion.
King Leucanor alarmed by the news of an imminent Scythian
attack was lured alone into the temple of Ares to take
a secret oath of friendship with Lonchates. There Lonchates
murdered him, cut off his head and escaped with it
under his cloak before the guards outside knew what had
happened.</p>
<p>Macentes too used subterfuge, for hurrying to the Machlyans
he reported King Leucanor&rsquo;s death, said falsely that
the Bosporans called Adyrmachus as his son-in-law to be
their king, and offered while Adyrmachus rode at full
speed to them, to escort after him his bride Mazaea in the
wagon-train, for she, he claimed, was a relative of his own.
This plan worked so smoothly that Macentes, when night
came on, took Mazaea from her carriage, put her on his
horse with himself and galloped off with her to Arsacomas.
The horse dropped dead at the end but the kidnapped
bride was delivered. Then all three friends united in the
battle against Adyrmachus, slew him on the field, and by
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
nightfall had won a victory. The next day peace was
negotiated. Such are the deeds of daring which Scythians
perform for their friends.</p>
<p>In the papyrus fragments a lady in distress is weeping
and lamenting in the tent of a general Eubiotus. He
clears his tent because of her woe, hears her declare that
she wishes she had never seen Eraseinus (apparently her
lover) and prevents her attempted suicide by wresting her
sword from her. She then tells Eubiotus that she is not
the Amazon Themisto though she is so disguised, but a
Greek girl Calligone. Here the fragments end. The
only points in common with Lucian&rsquo;s story are the geographical
background and the name Eubiotus (in Lucian
the illegitimate brother of Leucanor and an aspirant to his
throne),<a class="fn" id="fr_361" href="#fn_361">[361]</a> but both stories as Rostovtzeff points out look
to history for characters and setting as the Ninus Romance
did.</p>
<p>In the <i>Toxaris</i> the coloring is only quasi-historical
through the mention of names of kings and their lineage:
the story is not history, but an historical novel. And the
connection of the Scythians with the Sarmatians, the Alans,
the Maeotians and the Bosporans corresponds only in part
with their actual relations at the time. The Sauromatians
are a relic of the past; the Alans represent actual conditions
in the time of the author. The geographical coloring
is likewise only partly historical. The picture of the
Scythians even with its tendency to idealization represents
the people fairly. They are nomadic, poor, with a free
democratic political organization without kings, and they
are warriors. Their gods are the sword and the wind.
Their customs are primitive. They make war on their
neighbors and have special relations with the Greek states
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
on the Bosporus and Olbia and visit those on the south side
of the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Lucian in composing his <i>Toxaris</i> probably had in hand
a Greek romance with a Scythian background, containing
certain historical and ethnographical material. This he
worked over making his story represent what his public
then knew or could know of the Scythians and their neighbors.
The discovery of the papyrus fragments of the Calligone
novel confirms this thesis.<a class="fn" id="fr_362" href="#fn_362">[362]</a> The type of the <i>Toxaris</i>
story and the papyrus story is the same. Both were
love romances, though in each the erotic motif is subordinated
to adventure. The interest of the age in the unfamiliar,
the strange is manifested in the selection of
Scythia for the background.</p>
<p>Lucian&rsquo;s narrative is intensely exciting as well as picturesque
and although it is only a miniature story it gives
us an idea of another love romance of a wild type with a
king&rsquo;s head cut off for vengeance, a bride kidnapped on
horseback and an army raised on the ox-hide. The whole
<i>Toxaris</i> indeed, as Croiset remarked,<a class="fn" id="fr_363" href="#fn_363">[363]</a> with its ten anecdotes
furnishes rich examples of Lucian&rsquo;s art of narration.</p>

<br /><i>A COMPARISON OF THE GREEK ROMANCES AND APULEIUS&rsquo;</i> METAMORPHOSES</h2>
<p>Apuleius, the author of the greatest ancient novel extant,
might, if he had chosen, written his book in Greek instead
of Latin. Though he was born in North Africa (at Madaura)
he was educated in Athens as well as Roman Carthage
and Rome, indeed was completely bi-lingual. The
letter from his wife produced as evidence in his trial for
having won her affections by magic was in Greek. And
private correspondence demonstrates fluency in the language
even more than does the fact of his translation of a
work by Plato and his Latin style richly colored by Greek
syntax and vocabulary.</p>
<p>Some reader may now ask as Apuleius anticipated:
&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_364" href="#fn_364">[364]</a> So I must refer all to my other
writings about him and briefly characterize him here for
the uninformed.<a class="fn" id="fr_365" href="#fn_365">[365]</a> Apuleius was born about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 125 in
the Roman colony of Madaura where his father was a leading
citizen and official. He was educated at Carthage,
Athens and Rome, was certainly bi-lingual and probably
tri-lingual as he must have known Punic as well as Latin
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
and Greek. Returning to Africa, he practiced successfully
the art of a sophist, giving public discourses, many of
them impromptu. Specimens of these are extant in a collection
of extracts from his speeches called the <i>Florida</i>.
He married a wealthy widow, mother of a university friend
at Athens, and was promptly sued by his in-laws for having
gained her hand by magic practices. The brilliant speech
in which he defended himself at Sabrata against their
charges, the <i>Apologia</i>, is extant and constitutes his autobiography.
St. Augustine called him a Platonist and he did
indeed try to convey Plato&rsquo;s ideas to his contemporaries in
works on <i>The God of Socrates</i>, <i>Plato and his Doctrine</i> and
other lost writings. His fame when he was alive rested
on his oratory and it was so great that he was honored by
statues and made priest of Aesculapius at Carthage. But
his undying glory comes from his novel, the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.
The date of its composition is uncertain as indeed
are most of the dates of his life. He lived from about <span class="small">A.D.</span>
125 to <span class="small">A.D.</span> 171, that is, in the time of Antoninus Pius and
Marcus Aurelius. He was therefore a contemporary of
Lucian and may have met him as Walter Pater imagines in
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i>. What concerns us here is his novel
and its relation to the Greek Romances.</p>
<p>The <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Apuleius is a long story written
in eleven books. It is an ego-romance with Lucius a Greek
acting as narrator and hero.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The plot is simple. The hero Lucius who is greatly interested
in magic is enabled by the aid of the maid-servant of a witch to
achieve transformation. But a mistake in the use of the unguents
changes him not into a bird as he had planned, but into an ass.
Although he knows that the antidote is a meal of roses, he is kept by
Fortune from securing release through long months and meets various
adventures until at last through the aid of the goddess Isis
Lucius the Ass becomes again Lucius the Man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_366" href="#fn_366">[366]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The similarity of this plot to that of the Greek <i>Lucius or
Ass</i> is apparent at once. But its unique differences caused
by diversification of anecdotes and long additions become
clear as we read the narrative.</p>
<p>Lucius in the beginning was travelling in Thessaly riding
his white horse over the high mountains when he fell
in with two other travellers. One of these as they rode on
together related a horrible story of how his friend Socrates
saw a companion murdered by a witch. The scene of the
story was set in Hypata, the very city to which Lucius was
going. And the narrative of it by its effect on Lucius reveals
all his credulity and curiosity about witchcraft.</p>
<p>Lucius was entertained at the house of Milo to whom
he brought a letter of introduction and soon he learned
from a relative in Hypata, named Byrrhaena, that Milo&rsquo;s
wife Pamphile was a witch. Hypata was full of stories of
marvellous happenings and soon Lucius heard another of
these thrillers at a dinner-party given by Byrrhaena. It
was the story told by a guest Tlelyphron of how he
watched a corpse for pay and thereby suffered mutilation
of his face by a foul beldam. It was on the way home from
the party that Lucius, jittery and drunk, fought his fatal
battle with three bold robbers who afterwards, at his trial
for murder at the Festival of Risus, god of laughter, were
proved to be wine-skins!</p>
<p>Now Lucius was determined to investigate magic rites
by personal experience so he made ardent love to Pamphile&rsquo;s
servant Fotis until the enamored girl consented
to let him peer through a crack in the door of Pamphile&rsquo;s
bed-room and see her mistress transform herself into an
owl. This marvel witnessed, nothing would satisfy Lucius
but to attempt a similar transformation. Unfortunately
Fotis gave him the wrong unguent for the necessary
lubrication of his body and he became not a bird, but an
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
ass! The careless maid swore that the antidote was simple,
merely a meal of roses, and if he would quietly spend
the night in the stable, in the morning she would bring
him a breakfast of the flowers. Unfortunately before
dawn robbers arrived, pillaged the house and stole, along
with Lucius&rsquo; own horse and Milo&rsquo;s ass, Lucius the ass to
carry the plunder. This was the beginning of a long
series of adventures for the man-ass before he could achieve
re-transformation.</p>
<p>In the robbers&rsquo; hide-out in the mountains Lucius heard
the robbers tell three fine stories of their brave chieftains.
There too he saw a band of robbers bring in a captive
beauty Charite and heard her piteous tale of how she was
kidnapped on her wedding-night for ransom. To cheer
this weeping girl the old woman who cooked for the robbers
told in their absence the story of Cupid and Psyche.</p>
<p>An old wives&rsquo; tale she called it, but Apuleius lifted the
folk-tale to the realm of the Olympian gods by making it
the love romance of Venus&rsquo; son Cupid and Psyche, a mortal
maid. Venus herself was the cruel step-mother who
tried to separate the lovers and set all sorts of impossible
tasks for Psyche. But the heroine triumphed over every
task by the aid of Cupid&rsquo;s minions on earth and in air. Finally
the king of heaven, Jupiter himself, called Psyche to
his high throne to receive the gift of immortality and
summoned all the great gods and goddesses to celebrate
her nuptials with the god of love himself.</p>
<p>This happy love romance diverted Charite only briefly,
but soon her lover disguised as a robber came and rescued
her and after causing the destruction of all the robber band
carried her away with Lucius to safety. Charite&rsquo;s story,
however, unlike Psyche&rsquo;s was not to end happily. For
after her marriage to her Tlepolemus, a former suitor
Thrasyllus because of jealousy made way with her husband
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
in a boar hunt, pretending his death was an accident.
Later when the villain was making ardent love to the
widow, the shade of her husband appeared and recounted
his murder at the hands of his friend. Charite by subtle
plans was able to put out Thrasyllus&rsquo; eyes for vengeance
and then stabbed herself over her husband&rsquo;s tomb. Thrasyllus
in repentance starved himself to death.</p>
<p>Lucius the Ass again left to the mercy of Fortune had a
series of degrading adventures which tended to make him
a pessimist. He witnessed the obscene orgies of a lewd
band of Syrian priests. He heard four naughty Milesian
Tales of corrupt women: &ldquo;The Lover under the Tub,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Baker&rsquo;s Wife,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sandals under the Bed,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Fuller&rsquo;s Wife.&rdquo; These Milesian Tales of triangular sex
episodes are succeeded in the novel by another group of
tragic stories which stir deeper waters. The first is a record
of the terrible oppression of the poor by an arrogant
young nobleman and how three fine young brothers who
went to the defense of the poor family lost their lives in a
noble cause. Then follows a tragic story of an amorous
step-mother and her attempt to poison her unresponsive
step-son. And finally comes the awful narrative of five
murders committed by one sadistic woman. Book Ten
concludes with the plan to display Lucius the ass in obscene
union with this condemned criminal at a public exhibition.
To avoid this horror, Lucius ran away from
Corinth to the sea-shore at Cenchreae and there found his
salvation.</p>
<p>For lying asleep on the sea-shore that night he had a vision
in the moonlight of the goddess Isis. In all her refulgent
beauty she told him of herself and gave him hope.
For she assured him that at the spring festival of the
launching of her sacred vessel she would give him certain
aid. And indeed it was at that festival in the midst of all
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
its brilliant pageantry that the priest of Isis offered the ass
a garland of roses and munching them he became man
again. No wonder that after that Lucius had only one
desire: to serve his savior.</p>
<p>Night after night he had new visions of the goddess and
under the direction of her priest he fulfilled all the arduous
preparations for the initiation into her rites. Finally
one night left alone in her temple he was vouchsafed that
mystic experience which only the elect may achieve, death,
rebirth, revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I approached the borderland of death, trod the threshold of
Proserpina, was borne through all the elements and returned; at
midnight I saw the sun shining with a brilliant light; I approached
the gods of the nether and the upper world and adored them in
person near at hand.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_367" href="#fn_367">[367]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After such exaltation Lucius consecrated himself forever
to the service of Isis. Soon going to Rome he continued
his worship at her temple there and by her direction
was twice initiated into the mysteries of the god Osiris
though the expense was great for &ldquo;this poor man of
Madaura.&rdquo; Under the blessing of Osiris he prospered
greatly as an advocate in the Roman Forum and finally
under the god&rsquo;s direction he was allowed to become one of
the Pastophores or high-priests of the cult. So ends his
metamorphosis and the novel.</p>
<p>Let us now return to the beginning. In the first chapter
Apuleius announced that he is telling a Greek story.
The main outline of his plot is indeed identical with that
of the Greek <i>Lucius or Ass</i>, which as we have seen, is an
epitome of the Greek <i>Metamorphoses</i> by Lucian. Apuleius&rsquo;
novel is clearly later than Lucian&rsquo;s because of rich
and notable additions to the plot of the epitome <i>Lucius or
Ass</i>. These additions are Milesian Tales, the Cupid and
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
Psyche story and the great eleventh book portraying the
worship of Isis, who redeemed Lucius from ass to human
shape.</p>
<p>The change in the tone of telling the whole story is significant
for while the earthy character of the original folk-tale
occasionally appears and there are recurrent glimpses
of Lucianic wit and satire, Apuleius&rsquo; <i>Metamorphoses</i> is
neither a comic romance nor a satire as Lucian&rsquo;s clearly
was. Apuleius wrote a serious novel, a sort of Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress of the Ass-Man in his quest for knowledge of marvels.
Whereas Lucian through satire degraded a simple
folk-tale, Apuleius exalted it by making the journeyings
of Lucius a search for the spiritual meaning of life. His
hero walks alone. The love romance in his story, the
Cupid and Psyche tale, starts with the Platonic conception
of the relation of Eros and Psyche, Love and the Soul, and
therefrom is lifted to the realm of the Olympian gods.
And finally the retransformation of Lucius is no chance
event, but a salvation wrought out by the mystic worship
of Isis.</p>
<p>The subjectivity infused in the plot by these additions
is enhanced by the fact that the hero-narrator Lucius is
identified with the author, implicitly at first in the Preface
and in incidental comment of author to reader; in the last
book by the identification of Lucius with &ldquo;the poor man of
Madaura&rdquo; so that the whole narrative becomes personal
experience. This fact involves another difference from
the structure of the Greek love romances. The action of
these love romances, as Riefstahl points out,<a class="fn" id="fr_368" href="#fn_368">[368]</a> is a &ldquo;closed&rdquo;
one: in the misfortunes which threaten the lovers through
Fortune, they must always remain faithful to each other
and stout-hearted in order to be re-united. So the circle
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
of the action is &ldquo;closed,&rdquo; for it is a great cycle in the life
of the hero which places him at the end just where he was
in the beginning. The action in Apuleius is &ldquo;open,&rdquo; for
the hero is bound and pledged to nothing. He goes
through his adventures with a light heart. He does not
need to prove his faith to any one. He does not need to
stand up to a test or even to remain true to himself. He
must needs wander, but there is no set purpose in his
journeyings. His sufferings are as spiritual as corporeal.
He is aware too of the misery of others in the world. And
in profound despair he must beg divine aid.</p>
<p>It is absurd to compare the plot of the whole novel with
the typical pattern of the Greek love romances and Fotis
with their heroines as Riefstahl does.<a class="fn" id="fr_369" href="#fn_369">[369]</a> The only great human
love-story in Apuleius&rsquo; main plot, that of Charite, is a
tragedy. It is like the Greek Romances in being a story
of high life and in this too is unique among Apuleius&rsquo;
novelle. But it is utterly different from the Greek love
romances in structure and tone. The only parallel to
them is to be found in the inset story of Cupid and Psyche.
Here the tale is of two young lovers unhappily separated
by the cruelty not of Fortune but of a greater goddess,
Venus herself. And only after the hard testing of one of
the pair, this time the lady, are the two lovers reunited.
Thus the conventional happy ending of the plot is
achieved. But for the author&rsquo;s philosophical mind such
a beautiful story must start with a touch of Platonic symbolism
in the very names of the lovers, Cupid and Psyche,
and must be concluded in high heaven, for only among
the immortals may such perfect happiness be won forever.</p>
<p>From this account of Apuleius&rsquo; <i>Metamorphoses</i> it is already
clear that his great novel is a synthesis of various
types of Greek Romances. Its closest parallel is in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
Greek <i>Lucius or Ass</i>, for the bare outline of the plot of the
first ten books is like that of the Greek work. But all recent
research tends to prove that Lucian&rsquo;s original <i>Metamorphoses</i>
was satiric in character, therefore very different
in tone from Apuleius&rsquo; serious work. So although they
share the characteristics of a romance of adventure, with
stories of magic and of robbers forming principal episodes,
the motivation and the aim of the two romances are utterly
different. This difference is emphasized by Apuleius&rsquo;
two longest and most startling additions to the plot, the
love-story of Cupid and Psyche and the story of Lucius and
Isis.</p>
<p>Apuleius writes a love romance like the Greek only in
the story of Cupid and Psyche. For the episode with Fotis
is a sex-story of convenience and the Milesian Tales added
to the plot of <i>Lucius or Ass</i> carry out this Fotis-motif of sex
and lechery.<a class="fn" id="fr_370" href="#fn_370">[370]</a> The one long love-story of human beings,
Charite&rsquo;s story, is indeed a love romance of a noble lady
and her noble lord, but it is a complete tragedy in episodes,
tone and ending. Only the Cupid and Psyche story is the
true type of Greek love romances.</p>
<p>The third great interest in the Greek Romances besides
adventure and love was religion. To this Apuleius gave
a new emphasis and a new importance. In the center of
his novel in the inset story of Cupid and Psyche he pictures
the old familiar Olympian gods in their conventional
mythological characters, but as realistically and with as
implicit a satire as Lucian used in his &ldquo;Dialogues of the
Gods.&rdquo; Venus is a very jealous and cruel step-mother.
Jupiter is a lusty, amorous, irresistible king. Cupid is at
first undutiful, mischievous and wanton. The story of
Lucius and Isis is, however, a serious story of a great religious
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
experience. Through prayer, visions, priestly instruction,
ceremonials, initiation and communion Apuleius
becomes one with the goddess to whom he is to devote
the rest of his life. The worship of Isis is pictured spiritually
from the depths of experience by Apuleius who according
to his own statements had actually been many
times initiated in her cult.<a class="fn" id="fr_371" href="#fn_371">[371]</a></p>
<p>Throughout these three parts of Apuleius&rsquo; novel with
their successive emphasis on adventure, love and religion,
virtually all the conventional devices of the Greek Romances
are employed. In the stories of adventure there
are rapidly shifting scenes, though in a more limited spatial
area. The Greek love romances lie according to the time
of their action in the geography of the colonies of great
Greece or within the boundaries of the hellenistic-oriental
world from Byzantium to Egypt, from Sicily to Babylon.
The action is carried out through long sea voyages, varied
with storms and shipwreck. The wide world, the spatial
separations are overcome only through the faithfulness of
the lovers. The Ass-story takes place in narrower compass,
in old Greece between Patrae, Hypata and Corinth.
To Lucian&rsquo;s geographical set Apuleius adds Rome. In
these two versions of the Ass-story all the life of mankind
is represented concretely and in close perspective. The
action concerns little people living in one locality or for
purposes of trade taking short journeys hither and thither
on land.<a class="fn" id="fr_372" href="#fn_372">[372]</a> Other conventional devices in Apuleius&rsquo; stories
of adventure are the introduction as important characters
of robbers and robber chieftains, narratives with emphasis
on external events, descriptions like that of the robbers&rsquo;
cave.</p>
<p>In the love-story of Charite the interest centers in a lover
and his lass; both are persons in high life, both are faithful.
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
A dream furnishes an apparition of the dead husband.
But the villainy of a treacherous friend makes the story a
tragedy involving murder and suicide. The story of
Cupid and Psyche, true to the type of the Greek love romance,
starts with a religious beginning, the worship of
a mortal girl Psyche as the goddess of love; is motivated by
a Greek oracle; describes at length the proving of the
heroine in tasks imposed by the will of an unfriendly
deity; depicts Psyche&rsquo;s apparent sleep of death; and
finally consummates a happy ending for the lovers through
a saving god, who is Cupid the hero himself. A pastoral
note which affiliates the story with <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i> is
introduced by the presence of the friendly god Pan, who
acts as a wise old adviser and comforter to Psyche in her
great despair. And the conventional use of <i>excursus</i> creates
a new pictorial character in brilliant descriptions of
Venus charioted over the sea, of the Palace of Cupid, of
Cupid asleep, of the wedding banquet of the lovers.</p>
<p>In the story of Lucius and Isis in Book Eleven, many of
the conventional devices of the Greek Romances appear:
dreams, epiphanies, religious festivals, a <i>dea ex machina</i>.
So in Chariton Aphrodite and Fortune contend for the
control of the lovers; in Xenophon of Ephesus Artemis
and Isis are the two saving goddesses; in Heliodorus
Apollo and Isis are prominent though the philosophies of
the Gymnosophists and of the Neo-Pythagoreans have a
share in the plot; in Achilles Tatius Artemis reigns supreme;
in Longus Pan and the Nymphs guide the destinies
of the young lovers. The difference in Apuleius is
that the whole quest of the hero is for some meaning in life
and when magic, adventure, mythology and human
amours can not supply it, he finds through conversion a
union with a mystic goddess who sublimates his emotion
and absorbs his life into her service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The greater subjectivity of the Apuleius&rsquo; romance as
compared to the Greek Romances is attained by the aloneness
of the hero, his quest and its implicit meaning, his individual
satisfaction. This subjectivity is intensified by
the complete adoption of the ego-narrative. Far more
attention is paid by Apuleius than by the Greek romancers
to the narrator and to his point of view in telling the whole
romance. Achilles Tatius was afterwards to attempt the
use of this device of narration in the first person, but he
soon lost sight of the narrator in the narrative and even
at the end he never let him reappear. Lucian adopted
completely the <i>ich-roman</i> form, but, as far as can be
known, without rich characterization of the teller. Apuleius
uses to the full the advantage of having a man-ass as
narrator, for his composite hero has a duplex view-point
of man and animal and displays a double humor, of man
and beast. All this keeps the hero-narrator before our
eyes and we become ever more and more interested in the
effect of the events narrated on his inner life and on his
final solution of life.</p>
<p>Riefstahl points out that in the Greek love romances
there is some striving after subjectivity in the presentation
of external events. The possibility of expression is not
yet rich, but by soliloquies, by descriptions of emotions, by
reflections on events expressed in
<span title="gn&ocirc;mai" class="g">&gamma;&nu;&#8182;&mu;&alpha;&iota;</span>
the romancers are working from objective to subjective presentation of their
material. The soul is treated as an individual entity separated
from the body and contrasted to it. On this foundation
in the love romances rests the inner structural arch
of spatial separation and spiritual fidelity. The relation
of the objective and the subjective creates somehow the
scale on which all these romances take their place. The
love romances are at the objective end of the scale, the
older ones particularly, dynamic events holding writer and
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
reader spell-bound. In Longus a peaceful atmosphere is
created because there are few exciting events, little travel,
only the study of the development of love in two adolescents
in a quiet pastoral setting, but the expression is not
adequate. Longus senses the dual conception of Eros, in
man and in nature, for the love of the two young shepherds
is set in the teeming, growing life of the outer world, but he
does not develop fully this subtle implication. Achilles
Tatius inclines toward the subjective direction through
his attempted use of the ego-narrative. But the fullest
subjective treatment is found in Apuleius. In Achilles
Tatius as in Apuleius, the aim of the hero is a
<span title="myst&ecirc;rion" class="g">&mu;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&#8053;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>
but with him it is the
<span title="myst&ecirc;rion" class="g">&mu;&upsilon;&sigma;&tau;&#8053;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>
of love; in Apuleius it is the
<i>sacrorum arcana</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_373" href="#fn_373">[373]</a> The powerful cosmic force of love
appears only in Apuleius and there it is embodied in the
personality of Isis. The goddess describes herself to Lucius
as &ldquo;the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess
of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds,
chief of the powers divine, queen of all that are in hell,
the principal of them that dwell in heaven, manifested
above and under one form of all the gods and
goddesses.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_374" href="#fn_374">[374]</a></p>
<p>The whole story of Apuleius pictures, according to Riefstahl,
the striving of the individual towards the All. The
cosmic Eros has taken the place of the ancient Greek Eros,
who was a terrible power, often identified with the blind, cruel
<span title="Tych&ecirc;" class="g">&Tau;&#8059;&chi;&eta;</span>.
To this cosmic Eros Apuleius has given the
name of Isis.<a class="fn" id="fr_375" href="#fn_375">[375]</a> Riefstahl to be sure pushes too far his
theory of an underlying philosophical content in Apuleius,
representing the romance &ldquo;as an artistic unit ... and as
an issue of the writer&rsquo;s intellectual interests and personality,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ein k&uuml;nstlerisch gestaltetes Anschauungsbild der
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
existenziellen Lebensgrundlage des Neuplatonismus.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_376" href="#fn_376">[376]</a>
Yet he does point out astutely the fundamental difference
in Apuleius which makes his <i>Metamorphoses</i> another distinct
type of romance, the subjective philosophical.</p>
<p>A word now in retrospect. By the end of the second
century <span class="small">A.D.</span>, this new genre of literature, the romance, had
developed to full stature. Already besides the author of
the Ninus romance, Chariton, Lucian and Apuleius had
written their stories, and perhaps also Xenophon of Ephesus.
The different types of romance were already established:
the historical romance, the love romance with its
secondary interests of adventure and religion, satirical romance,
the subjective philosophical romance. The pastoral
was soon to be added. That is, in the second century
of our era, a new type of literature was created, a type
which was to be the most popular in the modern world.<a class="fn" id="fr_377" href="#fn_377">[377]</a></p>
<p>It is strange to find that so distinguished and perceptive
an historian as Rostovtzeff in his histories of Rome does
not recognize the significance for the early empire of this
new literary form. In describing the second century, he
writes:<a class="fn" id="fr_378" href="#fn_378">[378]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Except for the troubled reign of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman
Empire under the Antonines enjoyed profound peace, broken only
by distant wars on the frontier. Within the empire life appeared
to be, as it had been in the first century, a steady forward movement
for the diffusion and enrichment of civilization. The creative
power of Rome seemed to have reached its zenith. There was,
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
however, one disquieting symptom: after the brilliant age of the
Flavians we note an almost complete sterility in literature and art.
After Tacitus, and after the artists who worked for Trajan ...
the decades that followed failed to produce a single great writer or
a single notable monument of art....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even before the time of war and pestilence in the reign of Marcus
Aurelius, we mark in the whole of intellectual life not merely a
pause but even a backward movement. The only exception is a
revival of Greek rhetorical prose, perfect in form but monotonous
in substance. Its chief representative is the sophist and rhetorician,
Aristides, and his best work is his <i>Panegyric</i> on Rome. The
<i>Dialogues</i> of Lucian are witty and interesting; he was a sceptic
and a humorist who mocked all ideals both new and old. In the
West there are only two names to be quoted, that of the satirist
Juvenal, a gloomy and bitter observer of the dark side of human
life, and that of Pliny the Younger, a shallow orator and a brilliant
representative of the epistolary style. The rest both in Greece and
in Italy are writers of handbooks, text-books, and of miscellaneous
collections of entertaining stories for the amusement and instruction
of the reader.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rostovtzeff&rsquo;s omission of all reference to the Greek Romances
(even to Lucian&rsquo;s) and to Apuleius shows how
completely they have been disregarded. Yet for a picture
of the social life of the second and the third centuries and
of the psychology of the men of the time the Greek Romances
and Apuleius are a revelation.</p>
<p>The Roman empire had checked both political activity
and oratory, indeed the orator had been succeeded by the
rhetor in Greece and Rome. In the unified Mediterranean
world trade had developed greatly and travellers had
followed traders from one country to another, among them
the lecturing sophists. The new lands visited had their
curiosities and splendors so travellers&rsquo; tales multiplied with
descriptions often worthy of a natural history. Men, diverted
from the aims of personal ambition which military
conquest or a democratic state had afforded, now sought
release and excitement in the personal relations. Women
achieved a new freedom and a new importance. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
emotional life came to have a new interest and this led to
the development of the prose romance.</p>
<p>From the east came, with rich material resources, a
wealth of new ideas, a mingling of superstition, magic, religion
and philosophy. Just as man&rsquo;s emotions were
turned inward so was his thought. The greatest new adventure
became the quest for a solution of life itself. The
romances of the early empire whatever their type reflect the
age: its craving for excitement, its desire for adventure,
its dread of brigands, its curiosity about the new, its interest
in art, its wish for fulfillment of emotion in romantic
love, its awareness of unsolved mysteries in man and the
universe. With even the partial re-dating of the Greek
Romances all sorts of subjects open up for investigation
such as the apparatus of religion in the use of oracles,
dreams, epiphanies; the interest in works of art; the new
position of women. At any time in the future new fragments
of romances may be discovered, or new dating of
some of the old ones may be made possible. But even
now while archaeological discoveries are suspended and
publication of new editions is delayed, we may read and
re-read these amazing old stories and see what escape literature
was in the second and third centuries. The Greek
Romances have much to tell us of the psychology of their
authors, their characters, and their readers. They have a
deep human value.</p>
